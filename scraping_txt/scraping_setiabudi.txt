"Locating the best part of South Jakarta city, connecting to brand-shopping Mall, Lotte.  Due to Pandemic, hotel management reduces service and facilities including Manpower.  Please expect service level equal to Mercure, or Holiday Inn.  Please keep yourself more than to wait their response such as Breakfast time.  As told by the staff, you need to wait and understand due to they have only 2 servers for breakfast in the weekday time.  If you are expecting meet-to-level professionally hospitality standard, this is not hotel in option.  Try Fairmont, Westin, Kempinski, Hyatt, or Oriental would persurade expectation level - to 'the Raffle's standard'";
"If your looking for a luxury hotel in Jakarta, then you won't go wrong with Raffles   The rooms are well furnished and large and have a luxury feel.  Breakfast and Room Service is of a very high standard   The Pool area is quiet and has good facilities.   The only issue would be the lack of decent restaurants and bars, the main restaurant is quite stale and the writers bar is always quiet and seems like an after thought, but due to the location there are many decent restaurants and bars close by.  Last but not least the staff service is excellent.";
"I have stayed in hotels around Jakarta and raffles is by far the best. In terms of hard product and service, they surpass other hotels, four seasons do not even come close.   Their facilities are amazing, well equipped gym, pool, jacuzzi and even tennis courts. The service is top notch. U have a butler to take care of your requests and you reach him/her by text on whatsapp. Room is spacious, clean and modern. I stayed in artiste suite. I love how attentive and detail oriented the hotel is, they even wrap the cables of lamps etc....   The staff are all very accomodating, professional. They deserve every praise I could give them. Keep up the good work and do not hesitate choosing to stay in Raffles.";

"1. It was located in Jakarta's Golden Triangle, Kuningan, South Jakarta. It was also accessible by Transjakarta, and soon by LRT. The building was surrounded by many office buildings, shopping centers (Plaza Festival, Setiabudi One, Kuningan City, Lotte Shopping Avenue, and Kota Kasablanka), and also a sports center (Plaza Festival). The hotel itself was located on top of The Gama Tower, with a special lobby apart from the office‚Äôs lobby. The main lobby (Sky Lobby) was located on the 52nd floor. They also had a Spa, Gym, and Swimming Pool on the 50th floor, and a restaurant on the 51st floor.  2. The room was so large, spacious, clean and cozy with a modern interior design. I booked a Westin Room - City View. It had a large king size of bed with a duvet, which would directly";
"Spend two nights here using their great value Thank You Jakarta Voucher. The lobby is located in the 52th floor, once arrived at the floor you will be greeted by 360 degrees view of the city.  Check-in process was quick and smooth, the reception even gave us an upgrade to a bigger room in a higher floor. Requested dowel decoration for my wedding anniversary was not present but it was normal because of the room upgrade. In return, the hotel gave us a surprise cake!  The room was huge! Plenty of space for our kid to run around. The room have a walk-in closet to store all our luggage, hanged clothes, and stuffs. Bathroom was also huge with separate bath tub and shower.  The breakfast is was impressed me. They no longer serve buffet, it replaced with an all- you-can-eat breakfast";
"The service was great, overall room is spacious and comfortable.  The gym and pool facilities are good. With less people there, it was quite comfortable to use even during this time.   The food and service in lounge was great. Much better taste than breakfast. And the staff were mostly helpful and friendly.    However, other than those, a lot of things need improvement.   Food was quite dissapointing especially during breakfast. Taste was minimal, not a 5stars hotel quality. They also served the wrong order and then informed that they can't serve me the right menu because it will take some time to make it. They did give me few pastries to "make up for it".   Room service definitely needs attention. The pen provided in the room was very dirty, a lot of hairs (not mine), dusts are";
"The view from this hotel room, especially premium type above is amazing, make u feel like staying in heaven coz its so high and u even can see the sea from 63th floor.  You will feel a very unique experience stay in this hotel by its view. The room was very comfy, the bed was so soft. The restaurant was spacious and food was delicious.  Westin is definitely one of the hotel on the must try list";

Positive / plus points: - The hotel is relatively new, only a few years old so condition is still very good.  - Hotel has nice view of Jakarta  - Rooms are nice, pretty big, clean and has comfortable bed.  - Water pressure is excellent - Health protocols are quite good.  - Gym is pretty big and well equipped  - Foods quality are good, most of them are delicious & enjoyable  - Services in general are very good, especially staffs at the Seasonal Taste restaurant   Things to improve: - Rooms design.  An Executive suite room that we occupied should have better bath room, it should have come with 2 sinks / wash basin.  The shower room should be bigger and designed with better door so not too";

"The Grove Suites is located in the Epicentrum Superblock---a master planned development with shops, restaurants and green space to enjoy.  It is also just minutes away from major business and entertainment districts in Mega Kuningan and the Sudirman Business District.  I have been in and out of Indonesia for much of the last five years and The Grove Suites is my "home away from home."  The suites are oversized and spacious and even include a small kitchen area for longer stays.  The property includes a large pool, spa, restaurant, mini-gym and a musholla.  The best part of staying here, however, is the great service provided by the staff.  They are gracious and attentive....and do a great job of making guests feel welcome.";
"The location of this hotel is in kuningan area, famous business and entertainment center of Jakarta. The room is unique and big, like apartment with living room and kitchen. They also provide the kitchen set, including electric stove, so we can cooking in our room. But too bad, the breakfast is so standard in taste and not many variation comparing with other hotels in the same starr classification.";
"more menu breakfast, western menu en more...........the room unit model is very artistic modern minimalist.....overall service is very satisfying one of the best options for a relaxing stay.......highly recommended to stay again";
"I took my family to staycation at the Grove for 3 days and 2 nights. The apartment have a cozy living room, with the dining room and open space kitchen, so we all feel very close to each other. The kitchen have stove but we can not cook in here, they plugged off the gas. The outside ambience is quiet good for morning walks, and near the Epiwalk mall, so you don't have to be afraid of running out of food and beverages.";
"I'm enjoy with all facility the hotel and i Will to come again with the others family. Very nice experience, but i can not swimming because any protokol health about Corona virus. Thanks for all service";
"overall the services are very excellent, if only citadines have a instrumental / music in every floor of them, it would very great to repel out silent & fearful.  oh the other minus is the room isnt soundproof but thats not a big problem. thankyou";
"Clean room, Good interior and ambience, Friendly staff, good service, and strategic place, very recommended to staycation or business meeting, traveling or family. the rooms are quite spacious for a very affordable price.";
"Citadines located right at the central one of the busiest office street in south Jakarta, right next to the one of the most expensive hospital, close to food plaza, just 5 mins walk to busway station. Room size is big, it has 2 electrical stove,nice couch and good internet connection,   one thing they need to fix immediately is one of their elevator which has been out of service for more than a month already!";
"1 lift on 2 was under maintenance. 2 lifts are already not enough for this high building. Only 1 elevator working with limited occupency due to social distancing is making  huge waiting time. this hotel seems also not having lift for service. The staff and luggage service are using the only lift available. Indonesian traffic jam.. ;-)    Also many very small ants in room coming after 5pm...";
"I've just stayed at Citadines Rasuna for 1 night, however it was absolutely memorable and enjoyable. The staffs were helpful with the fast actions, the location was so great, much more great things. And this is it, the room was completely pleasurable and suitable with the mood. At the certain thing, i will return to stay there in the future.   Thanks for everyone there  Personally say thanks to Mr. Atta (Duty Manager).   Growing greater and bigger for Citadines Rasuna";

The food was great...nasi bakar n iga gorengnya enak banget. altho the scramble and omellette needs improving,but other than that i enjoyed the food.";

"I had read good reviews about the Oakwood hotel chain and hence decided to stay at Oakwood Premier Cozmo in Jakarta when I was here for my business trip. However, I was totally disappointed with the experience I had during my stay.  Firstly, it seems that the hotel has not been able to enforce their "so-called" COVID-19 safety protocols. There were times that I saw other guests not wearing mask in the lift or even at the main lobby, which was just in front of the reception counter!   Secondly, although I was staying on a non-smoking floor because I have bad allergy to cigarette smoke, I could always detect cigarette smoke smell in my apartment. Despite highlighting to the hotel staff, they were unable to stop this from happening. They would always give excuses that they had";
"Our family hasn't had a travelling or go for holiday since this pandemic. So, as the children start to bored at home, I decided to have staycation, and we choose to stay at Oakwood Premier Cozmo for the long holiday on August 2020,because the location is strategic, near lots of mall, and restaurant. Good ambience to have a walking and running activities, doing groceries, etc. At that time, we had 2 bedroom Suites. The room is so large, with a big window so we can get a good sunlight from outside, and the furniture, is very clean, neat, tidy, feels like a 5 stars home. The kitchen and the cooking utensils are very hygiene, all wrapped in plastic and sealed. And for our protection, Oakwood allowed us to have breakfast at the room. It such a great experience spending our long";
"Great experience for staying in this apartment for two nights. Breakfast was so great and the rooms were clean and comfort. The reception was also great and it located in a strategic area in Jakarta. Recommended for everyone who need a satisfaction vacation with families.";
"My second stay at this property. Coronavirus chaos happening on the outside, perfect harmony inside the property.   Everywhere I went throughout the hotel, I was met with a smile, and a 'could I help with anything'. The food, rooms and levels of service are second to none.  The staff could not do enough to ensure I expereicned the perfect stay.";
"I stayed for two nights and booked an Executive room. The check-in process was quick and no-nonsense, which I appreciated. However, I didn't get recognition as a member of Marriott Bonvoy programme (I did get the recognition the next day through the app, though). Upon entering the room, I was amazed by the surprise the hotel team had prepared for me, including the drawings on the window and a complimentary cake. The room was somewhat smaller than expected and the furniture were kind of dated design-wise but they didn't greatly affect the comfort level of the room (in fact, I enjoyed staying in my room, reading books by the window while sipping a cuppa or merely watching TV).  The bathroom was okay. It had a good-size bathtub. The shower area wasn't super spacious but that wasn't";
"I chose to stay in JW Marriott to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday, my bro‚Äôs birthday and my wed anniversary.   1st disappointment A week before, I texted the hotel to request for birthday decoration for my mom, so it would be ready when we arrived at room. However, it didn‚Äôt happened. We arrived and no decoration. A minute later, 2 staffs rang the bell and asked whether we want our room to be decorated. Of course, we said NO, because the surprise sensation was no longer there, my mom was in the room already. And another reason is, it‚Äôs pandemic, we wouldn‚Äôt let strangers come to our temporary place for doing the decorations.  2nd disappointment Our decision to stay during pandemic was tough. We dare to stay because it‚Äôs JW Marriot, a 5 star hotel. We thought that their protocol";
"Was staying here for two nights: 6 to 8 November at Room #1101.  Great room, with complete amenities and Hygiene set (includes Disposable mask and glove, hand sanitizer). Room was perfectly cleaned and great room service.   Beautiful Bathroom with Bathtub, powerful hot shower. No complain at all for the room.   However, the selection for breakfast should be much improved. Many stalls but with same food selection. Breakfast was limited only for 45 minutes (with batch card given during the check-in). I didn‚Äôt think it was for the protocole, since you would find a very full and packed restaurant during that given time. Shoud be considered if you want to have your breakfast here.";
"This is our first trip back to Indonesia since the world pressed the pause button and we were immediately reminded why this is a home away from home. We were checked in by Anya at the front desk who was a pleasure to speak to and the level of hospitality she delivered far exceeded our expectations.

Thank you JW Marriot for the nice place, foods, and the staff.";
"Having great stay here. Suggest not using pool at sunday morning if you want to enjoy peaceful swimming, many came with kids. Breakfast and cleanliness was superb. But what I love the most is the staffs that were so full of dedication to give the best for the customer. Recommended. The minus is the location which you can't just walk to shopping mall or restaurant, about 10 minutes to kota kasablanka mall by car (no traffic jam).";

Overall good hotel apartment and good location.";

"A good stay for Jakarta if you are searching for middle class stay with a good connection to the city centre.  Like the Aryaduta Hotel it need to be refurbished. It's not a classy hotel but an apartment complex. We had a two bedroom apartment. It comes along with two bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.   The staff is super friendly and helpful. We had an issue with an AC and it was fixed within minutes.  We mostly choose to stay with Aryaduta when we are in Jakarta also because of the breakfast. it's a huge selection of Indonesian and international dishes.  This Hotel comes along with a pool and a playground, that our daughter loved to use.  A small mall is around the corner and a MRT station is close within an 5 minute walk. So you can reach the city centre without any";
