Breakfast buffet was plentiful and the room, colonial style, was comfy. Apparently a bit on the outskirts of Jakarta the surroundings looked quite green.

"The staff at the hotel were very helpful and they provide the extra service requested.  Breakfast however need to be improved, selection was not as much as expected.

The breakfast was very limited, only nasi goreng and nasi lemak with some pastries and fruits. It wasn't not as I expected. It's location just opposite of Gelora Bung Karno, made it easier for us to did some workouts there.";
"I stayed this october during long holiday in Mulia Hotel with their special rates (promo). We highly appreciate for they arrangement, because they prepared good decoration for our wedding anniversary, and we really love the decoration and its cake.   However, we bit dissapointed with Breakfast in this hotel. They provided so ordinary choice of the breakfast. It didn‚Äôt represent breakfast of Five Star / Prestigious Hotel in Jakarta. Very limited option. I realize that i stay in this hotel with promotional rates, but i didn‚Äôt expect the service on their breakfast is dissapointed.   Previously, during pandemic, i also stayed in another hotel in Bandung. Let compare it with Trans Luxury Hotel Bandung. I didn‚Äôt know, if it‚Äôs comparable / peer to peer hotel or not, but in my opinion";

I got excellent services the front desk informed me that my room was upgraded to an executive room in 1625, the second highest level at the hotel. During pandemic, the room is sealed once already sanitized. And once entering the room, every thing is clean and tidy. With all compliments inside like Dilmah tea, Nescafe, mineral water that can be ask any time and free of charged.   The foodies that can be delivered to the swimming pool at pulau bar & V posture gym/sauna are my favorite things to enjoy.

"This is my first stay here during pandemic. I can understand that they make some adjustments like in the breakfast and some other services. Some facilities were geting more limited but their effort to continously provide the best services is apreciated.  The room was still clean and well arranged. The food were also great although there was no buffet but their fast service especially in the breakfast time did not let me down.  Some staffs like Marisha and Ricardo were quick and caring. They also sanitize the table and chair first. Beside the room which were profesionally arranged by Ari, Lidya and Pamela, Bunk was always my favorite. I always love the coffee. Endang and Ikbal were also caring  and also ask if I need anything else. Thanks for take away coffe to accompany me";
"Impressions of the room, great, it has a different layout and that makes the room feels  spacier and modern. Great sanitation, the All Safe standard is high and it feels clean and safe, hand sanitizers at every elevator, inside and outside of it. Waiter brings you hand sanitizer after contact.   My biggest concern is the food, it makes no effort whatsoever to even compete with the surroundings eating places at Central Park. It's a sub par food, came cold, and the meat was dry. The exorbitant price of 160.000++ for a meek of 8 pieces of satay is ridiculous. It's even more expensive compared to the sister hotel a Five Star, Pullman Vimala Hills Ciawi, at a much much lower quality of food.   Second concern is the in room TV, small and very old. The pictures are grainy too. It makes";

"I chose Harris because of its location. And I do believe that I could stay, wfh and rest peacefully. Unfortunately the other guests didn't respect it. Most of the time, the other guests next door can't keep their voice low and even laughing in the corridor. For the staff, when the guest put "don't disturb" tag, means that: please don't even make any noice in front of the room, beside not knocking on the door.   During this pandemic situation, hope Harris also more strict to people who wanted to visit the guest. Prescreening point in the front of the door needs to be lift up by putting also disinfectant for the shoes  For food quality, I was disappointed. For someone who needs to stay still in the room, and no choices to order from outside, you must be very patient till your end";

Because I wanted to secretly surprise him, I contacted the FO, her name was Ms. Nurul. She really helped me in coordinating the plan to give this surprise. This includes allowing me to send gifts and birthday cakes using a courier service before we check in. The team was very helpful and friendly. Even the room was helped with decoration and gifts and cakes were immediately placed in the room as my request.  Upon check in, we were also given an upgrade to the Grand Deluxe Room. Our room was very spacious, clean, the bathroom was very comfortable and the room view was extraordinary (our room faced GBK, so both day and night the view of GBK was very";

Also had a pleasant morning walk around the hotel and generous portion of breakfast! Definitely will comeback :)";

"The location of this hotel is in one of the busy road in West Jakarta. During pandemi, they only open for one floor and smoking room. But the room not too smelly. The room not so big, but the interior is good enough and clean. They closed all the public facilities such as bar, gym, and swimming pool. The lobby looked like an empty hotel, they turn off the aircon at the lobby and and need morr lighting (too dark). The carpet in the room is so old and not clean enough.";
"I stayed there for new year. They had this "new year pajamas party" package so we took it. The room was nice, we asked for high floor and they provided that. It has a really big window giving us a really nice view on the city. The food in that party was so nice too! My favorite was the beef wellington. However, that night was raining so heavily (it was the the night before Jakarta had a really terrible flood). And in the morning, we realize that our room was dripping wet. There was a leak on the ceiling. We complained about it when we had breakfast, but it seems like even after the breakfast, that situation hasn't been handled and now the floor is even wetter.  Check out was a chaos too. The elevator didn't work so we had to use the stair (and remember I told you that we have a";

Feel the sensation of sleeping next to a running powerful generator.  The humming noise is very loud and unbearable. In fact it is 03:02AM now and I still wide awake from the noise.

I don‚Äôt know what happen there or the sop for them but I think what happened to me as their guest were rude. My friend and I were came to the hotel with a car and driver, from the beginning the security guard give us a kinda rude attitude, without any clear instruction to enter the main gate and do the security check. We still ok with that. Then, we have to wait about one hour and half at the lobby. And for the first time, I felt so annoyed with the security guard. He was walked around us and looked curious and annoyed with us. As my experiences, we can meet someone at the lobby, right? Even we can talk";
"Located at Central Jakarta, Lumire is a perfect location to those who have a working purpose around this area : meeting a collegue, attending a seminar, or even a short getaway. As I believe, a new inspiration sometimes comes from a a right place at a right time. . The room itself is 37sqm sized, completed with a kingsize bed, a working desk and a bathtub. If you ask me what is my favourite? Nothing else than the view of the iconic National Monument from my room window and an easily accessible shopping mall by walking. Love it!";

From the outside the building looks alright but the inside was kind of disappointing. The bathroom was unbelievable, it looked like it never been deep cleaned for ages! The shower worked funny and obvious never been taken care of, the drains weren‚Äôt really work and make it flooded, the same with the sink drain as well. The TV was very small like a computer screen but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Bed linens are washed but yellowish and worn out, the same with the towels.  The worst part was, I called the receptionist to clean my room but it never came.  Dear Amaris, please take a annual maintenance for your business. It could be better.";

I take Bussiness room. Got a kitchen, living room, bedroom, walk in closet and bath room (using bathup). Staff kind and helpfull. The plus point for me is the swimming pool area. For a little kids can play in the sand pool without worrying get drown. Food and beverages taste good. But it is a bit shame when breakfast time in resto, the staff is not fast response to re-stock the food / cutlery. There also a taxi pool for pax who don't bring vehicles.";
"The best place for staycation in Jakarta area.   Kids love the giant pool and the sandy man-made beach.  Strategic location near the mall. Fast wifi.  Dusty floors when we first check in. Dim lighting, old furniture. The breakfast crew service and the food taste need to be improved.   Many food stalls were emptied during bfast time. The refill time took so long. The spring bed was not so comfortable, and the pillows were so big but hard, useless. Lucky we brought additional pillows from home, otherwise we couldn't sleep well during our stay.  Anyways, compare to its spacious room size and the price, it's so value for money.";
"I stayed for 1 night only, with my parents. The room was a bit old (room no : 703) but clean. Shower at the bathroom has a problem. During breakfast,  some of the menu was empty and took so long for the staff to refill.  The most disappointing part was the receptionist never inform us, if we bring a car, we need to get a stamp from the receptionist, so it will be free during check out. I found this problem, when I was in front of the check out gate, and the security guard inform me,I need to pay IDR 40,000 for the parking fee, but If I were a guest hotel, I can make it free if I had a hotel stamp on my parking ticket. Too bad that I received this important info at the very late time and circumstances. It is not possible for me to move backwards, due to so many cars behind me. I";

"Very spacious hotel room, it‚Äôs more likely a furnished apartment only the furniture looked a bit worn out, need to be renovated. However, when I booked for non-smoking room, but everytime we enter the room, I sensed smokey air inside. Perhaps the previous guest smoked there.  Cool AC in 1 room but not cool AC in living room and the other room, but after telling the housekeeping about the problem, the engineer fixed the master bedroom AC and it was so cool. Thank God for that so we had decent sleep, apart of the too bouncy spring bed (I‚Äôd personally prefer the harder ones).

It is in South Jakarta so it's over an hour to North Jakarta. The hotel itself is pretty good but slightly faded. The room was nice and big and very brightly lit. Noisy, being next to the bus station and a mosque with regular calls to prayer. The breakfast was excellent with numerous choices from a variety of cuisines. Staff were really helpful.";
"I stayed two nights for business trip at this hotel and had a twin-bed room at 6th fl. First image that I received from this hotel when I arrived was: "O-o not my type". It is an old hotel and not maintain adequately. The carpet on meeting room at 2nd floor was very dirty and urgently need to be replaced. The WiFi on the meeting room was unstable, and I prefer to used my own MiFi. The partition between meeting room was not soundproof, so we could hear what other presenter saying on the next meeting room. That's annoying.  The bed room was quite spacious (about 24-26 m square), and fortunately without carpet and have a very bright lighting system and convenient for working with laptop at night.
