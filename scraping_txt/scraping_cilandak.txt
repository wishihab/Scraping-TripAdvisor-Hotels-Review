"Relaxing Hotel in the Middle of bustling city of Jakarta.. The hospitality, and the politeness of the staff were superb. The room cleaned, and my sons were enjoying the pool.. The breakfast was delicious. Despite the price was relatively cheap, but the the quality was expensive.";
"Overall I'm satisfied. Good 👍🏻. Check-in and Checkout was handled efficiently and in a friendly manner.  Our room had a good size with amazing view. The rooms are spacious and are very comfortable, good service, clean, tidy, and the swimming pool was fine. Could happily recommend to traveller.";
"I was request for early check in, and the process went very smooth. The room is very neat and clean. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. WiFi and TV cable also great. The location is above mall, easy to get lunch, and very near to MRT.";
"Very convenient and superb location, right next to MRT station and shopping center just downstairs.. Pool is great Very convenient bathroom with jet shower toilet.. This is my 2nd stay and will definitely recommend and stay here again..";
"Eventhough this hotel doesnt apear like a hotel from outside view, but after you get inside the lobby you'll find smart simple reception desk that serve us good n clearly. The breakfast package was also good in appereance and taste too.";
"I spend 2 nights  for staycation  to do work.. The bathroom is quite clean and the soap and shampoo smell good which is my favorite (smells of green tea). In room I can find a set of tea, coffee, sugar, creamer along with a heating pot. There is also mineral water 1L but it's in charge which is I don't like it and pretty shame.   I got back view and there is nothing to see and very dark when its night. The pool not really clean, because many leaves fell in that pool also not given chlorine which is useful as a virus prevention.  They have gym fasilitation, also clean. Public toilet, lobby, restaurants, really love it so comfy, with wood nuances and aglonema ornamental plants along the lobby.   The hotel very near with Cilandak Town Square, and other food station so I'm not";
"Greeted by Mba Rika, very friendly and informative! park 5 has a great place and great ambience, a nice place for staycation or business trip. Also have a clean room and perfect view from balcony! definitely will come back";
"Park5 simatupang was one of the great choice for family or couples for shortcation or weekend. The place is cozy with various drink and delicious food to have. All the staffs are very helpful and kind. Especially miss Riyanti who helped us to choose a great breakfast, brunch and dinner. Aglio olio, Hainan chicken rice, pizza, fish and chip with tahu udang were delicious and recommended 👌😊👍👍👍👍";
"I've been staying in this hotel very often, The staffs were friendly and helpful, the room was always clean. the best choice to spend your weekend or even having a short staycation! <3 never a regret anything when I stayed here";
"Check in was so smooth, requested for a very clean room because of pandemic. Room is indeed clean and tidy. Thank you HK Team esp Mrs Annis and Fepta. Will definitely comeback again. Keep up the good work! Cheers! 👌🏼";
"We had a really nice stay at RA. As we were self quarantined, room service was delivered for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As we are both vegan the cook made us delicious plantbased meals with a lot of variation. Also the rest of the service was wonderful.   The location is allright, though near a big road which is quit loud if you are at the pool.";
"WORST EXPERIENCE ! Nothing’s went well!  1. Long wait when check in. We checked in at 2pm but we waited for 1 hour to get our room ready!  2. BAD internet connection. The wifi speed is so frustrating. We stayed in executive suite rooms at 7th floor and the wifi connection is very poor. Even for Telkomsel signal is just 1 bar here.  3. THE FRONT OFFICE NUMBER IS SO DIFFICULT TO BE REACHED! I’m requesting an additional towel and I have to tell them 3 TIMES WITH OVER THAN 5 ATTEMPT TO CALL! My friends decided to goes down to the receptionist for req additional towel but they still didn’t give FAST ACTION! This is so frustrating.   4. The electrical is totally disgusting. In the morning we are using stove and microwave but the electrical insufficient ! The electrical down for more";
"A Beautiful Hotel, start from my arrival, greeted happy birthday to me😍  by the friendliness of the hotel staff. Really had greatest time with the most loving friends here. Cozy place, great service, and what a beautiful pool. Covid protocol perfectly done, the room was very clean, and they sent me a beautiful noted happy birthday wowww made my heart more happier at that night. They have Rumangsa Coffee at the lobby floor, the coffee was really good and quite cheap, I love it. Thankyou very much Ra Simatupang what a happiest ever staycation. Thankyou so so much to Ibu Amanda and team for your nice and honest hospitality. I definitely recommend Ra Simatupang and will come back again soon💋";
"Great experience. The suite room (3 bedrooms) are amazing, service are quite nice and informative. The swimming pool is  and photogenic, it also had sitting area beside pool. They also had kids pool and outdoor playground. Breakfast in room is average, we only had bento breakfast (american breakfast in bento box) the sausage was not really good. But overall fine.";
"Whenever I stayed at RA , I’ve encountered difficulties in getting clear and stable tv programs.  It’s quite frustrating, as the tv will freeze or has nothing on the screen for sometimes or few minutes until it willl appear and breaking ups .. i’ve learned that i have to restart the set up box, instead of calling hskp each time to assist .. perhaps you may need yo change the tv cable provider.  Also in some suite rooms I stayed , tv is not available in the bedroom , and only available 1tv at the living room .. so perhaps you need to ensure the room readiness and it’s facilities consistancy.   Thanks ..   I look forward to staying at RA again in the near future ..";
"Thank you for your service. Especially for the staff Vantya, Dinda and Najib. Keep it up! The room is totally clean, their hospitality was great and a good place to stay with family. Would love to come back in thw future.";
"Great hotel with strategic location. Good hospitality from the staff especially front office, Also the room is clean and comfortable. I really recommend this hotel to all future visitors who want to stay. Ibis style Cilandak is simply one of the best hotel in South Jakarta.";
"From the momment i came here, i was greeted cheerfuly, and i got the room upgrade effortless without begging or asking (Because im All Gold). they will ask you all your prefrence and give you little touch of welcome   in my case fruits on afternoon and evening, one use Mask, and letter about #Allsafe. these kinda thing really make me feel welcome. it even surpasses Pullman and Etc for personal touch !  The breakfast are great in taste, really thanks to Chef Ujang and Restaurant staf Hana! theyre so kind and make the most delicious Noodle and fried rice (just like famous streetfood style)  I recommend this hotel, especially if you're ALL-Accor Member!";
"One of the best hotel with new normal protocols. Such a Cozy, artsy, modern and confy place with tasty bfast. I should to stay here again. I love the vibes of their lobby so much! So instagramable. Also the service is excellent:)";
"Semua staf ramah dan helpful  Sampe Jkt, jalan kaki ke ibis, lelah, stafnya bolehin early check-in.. alhamdulillah.   Room servicenya ok bgt. Makasih ya mas.   Keep healthy and safety for all staffs   See you soon";
"Cleanliness in details are really appreciated. May it happened only to me, that is simple but i have to see unwillingness things on my first impression when i came to the room, I really love the lobby! so fancy.";
"good quality and experience, nice place to stay very strategic  nice service from end to end, maybe we can stay at this hotel again someday, please keep aup the good service   thank you and enjoy stay at this hotel for everyone";
"Took 45 minutes to receive our dinner on the day we checked-in and our drinks order was incorrectly provided and alarmingly took 15 minutes to correct. When we chased our dinner order, we were provided a different excuse each time. We then asked to see a supervisor or manager and were told someone would come but no one did - even after we paid. We subsequently complained to the front office and again, throughout our 2 night stay, heard from no one. Unfortunately breakfast the following day was unpleasant, although we arrived around 1 hour before buffet closing, we had to ask the staff to replenish several items such as orange juice, milk and butter. Also, even though I declared my son in our booking (total 3 guests) our room was only provided 2 towels so I naturally requested";
"Everything was just ok. But the fb team, both services and cooks was nice. They served the guest fast and responses, the small resto was handled nicely eventhough the hotel was full. The food was ok for 3* hotel.";
"Dear Management Swiss Bell in simatupang, I mean giving this review to provide input to improve the service and quality of Swiss bell in hotels. overall, the room was clean and the food was good but the check in time needed to be fixed as i waited more than 40 minutes";
"Alisa a exelent person and professional. She knows and understand about the job, explaint closely during stay at Aston Bellevue for my bussiness traveling from 13rd - 16th of December 2020. I am happy for the room clean, nice view.";
"Good service for all staff hotel aston bellevue radio dalam staff restaurant kedaton good service Rara, diana, dan Rio.. i will comeback again with my friend and family.. good job and good luck. See you aston!!😍😊😊😊";
"Nice service for the all staff, kind, helpful, talk active to help someone to need something, especially for Rara. She's so kind and helpfully. But, for the menu so less variant, and we'll be better if the guest can take they self the baffet. Over all good service. Keep it up!";
"Hotel yang bagus dan makanan oriental yang enak. saran untuk American breakfast menu nya diperbanyak seperti tambahan Bacon. Friendly staff Rara. Highly recommend food is also good :) so nice and pleasant";
"Exelent for services by rara beutyfull nice and for food delicious.. for room nice. I will come back again... very nice black coffe  ✅☺️ And porridge so yummy i like... thankyou aston i will come back again";
"I stayed for 1 night and booked an apartment for 2 bedroom.. it was so huge i love it,, looks the real apartment not flat.. they have a pantry and swimming pool too.. i think this property a combination between hotel and apartment..";
"Booked 3 rooms, while make a reservation (18/02/2020) thru agoda,put request: Non smoking room on a higher floor, the next day got reply on my email that inform my request has been aproved.  Today when i was checking in the front desk staff (young lady) said there is no available Non smoking room in higher floor, Whaaaaattt?? So what is the point to send me an email that my request has been approved??  I showed her the email that i’ve got from kristal hotel, and she said that is only the automatic reply, 🥴🤷🏽‍♂️the other staff very friendly tho, specially the concierge,  I dont think im going back to stay at this property in the future";
"The Kristal is a fine hotel reminiscent of the 80's and 90's big hotel architecture and theme. Studio suite is large, well equipped with mini kitchen, the king bed is exceptionally comfortable with pillows for all sleeping preferences. The air conditioning works very well and the bathroom amenities are well planned. Laundry turnaround is same day, room service is fast with great food selection and reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, everything from eggs made to order to sushi, Thai, Indian and Western options offered daily. The dining room is quite large with excellent views available of the pool area. The resort style pool offers a swim up bar, extra lounges around the pool would be a plus. The gym is a highlight, extremely large and well laid out with state";
"We used to stay here since 2005, sometimes for months due to relocation. It was always good and a simple but comfortable home away from home. Today those days are gone. I do not know what happened? The staff are no longer motivated, rooms have not changed since 2005, it all looks tired. Prices are too high for what it is now. There are better options in the area for less.  An exemption has to be made for the satu lagi bar, there still seems to be a little vibe and staff seem to have fun in what they are doing. Keep up the good work!";
"It's been a while since my last review. A bit lazy to write, but the hotel ambience worth to review. I visited this hotel on December 2019, after having a long walk in Ragunan zoo. Too exhausted to drive home so we decided to spend one night to relax in this hotel. We chose this hotel coz it only took 15 minutes driving from the zoo. We booked for a 2-bedroom suite. Nothing special on the check-in process. They have two tower building and our room was located on the tower 2. The room is nice and big. Everything is efficiently arrange to create a cozy living enviroment. Eventhough small, the pantry has fridge,cookware hob and hood, dinner sets, microwave, toaster, dispenser and many things so you can prepare your own meal if you are so lazy to go out.  But i am not a big fan of";
"What the heck with this hotel! When i stay at this hotel for only ONE NIGHT, i experiencing 3 times electricity shut down in my room! What make it worst, all of it happens at night. I need to call receptionist 3 times for it! I try to ask to move to another room, but they said its full booked, weird thing is, in the middle of the night when i experienced my third shut down, they try to move us to another room! If there’s a room available, why they say full booked before? Shame on you. Just shame.";
"Little Amaroossa Residence is a unique 3 stars hotel. The hotel gives a stylish contemporary design room and good location in South Jakarta. The staffs are helpful and give a good smile. The rooms are spacious, nice designed, has wifi, and clean. The room carpet is vacummed regularly, which is good, free from dust. The price is affordable for a business hotel or family.  Over all, Little Amaroossa Residence is a unique hotel and stylish. Good to stay for family or business.";
"I‘ve spent two nights at this hotel for a business trip. I wasn’t expecting something extraordinary but surprisingly it caught my attention on interior design. I would say much better than plain interior on mostly 3star business hotels chain. Breakfast is also tasty, lot of choices even the chef gave a surprise food tough hahaha, it was a fun moment. I don’t know about some review out there but definitely this hotel is worth your money per night on its class.";
"Room smells old and damp, wall paint smudges, sheets no longer white, bathroom smells. I got the room on the 5th floor, was staying with my son and bought a few big bags. Elevator was on maintenance and none of the staff offered to help bring the bags upstairs. AC was not working properly, asked to move to another room but the staff immediately said sorry but no other room available without asking why I wanted to switch room or offered any assistance. Breakfast was disappointing, coffee was just warm, even when I asked for a hot one they still me the lukewarm one. Was staying there for the sake of a family reception at a nearby restaurant. Would not stay there again for sure. Too disappointing. I've stayed in cheaper hotels with better condition and amenities.";
"This is the first time I came to little amaroosa. All staff is amateur. Checked in is so slow.. I did direct booking through the website with the remarks " King bed&smoking" but when I checked in I repeat my request to have ' 1 King bed ' and he said ' yes ' in fact,  I got twin bed with adjoining bed without any information upon checked in ( this is terrible ) reception said that ' the bath towel has not ready yet so I have to wait until 19:00 to get the towel ' but I got the towel at 20:00 :'( .  Breakfast is 4/10 even compared with another budget hotel. They don't provide juices. And when I ask for omelete, the staff said " sorry it's sold out " and it's just at 8:30am. As I know, breakfast should provide the foods until it closed. This will be my 1st and last time to stay in";
"The hotel location is in south of Jakarta. The location not very strategic area. Far from downtown. But the hotel facility is Good. They have invinity pool on the roof top. The room is big enough and clean. They provide microwave in every room, but too bad they don't provide plate, spoon, or fork. We have to ask to room service if we need it.";
"Nice hotel, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. I enjoyed my 3 weeks stay at your hotel. The breakfast was good. Thank you for cleaning service team(Tammi & friends), laundry staff, good hospitality.";
"the hotel is part of an office building. When I came for the first time is make me confused because the office lobby related with the hotel lobby. I've got some complimentary snacks too. The room so clean & neatly with have a small pantry & the staff really humble & helpfully.";
"This hotel is strategically located on Pangeran Antasari south Jakarta. The hotel is part of an office building so you  need to find the lobby on the side entrance. It is still new with limited facilities. There is no restaurant yet accept on the roof top pool bar. Breakfast is served in the lobby with fair variety. The rooms are amazingly good and a small pantry with fridge and microwave is available. I really appreciate their internet tv services, one you don't get much often in other hotels. I am confident that once other facilities are provided, this hotel can become a favorite place for guests working near by office towers.";
"First of all, PSW Hotel is in the same building with PSW Tower. The Room is clean and all the furnitures 85% with gold colour. Looks like really glamour. All the staffs was Humble. I've got some complimentary snacks (available in every rooms). Also they have Oven and Toaster in the Room. Last, This hotel just need a little bit improve for their WiFi. Others, Perfecto!";
"What a beautiful property!  As a female traveling alone I requested transfers via the guest house, round trip from the airport, arriving and departing around midnight.  My ride was there when I arrived.  It took about 40 minutes to get to the property with a cool drive through the city. The hotel is a hidden gem, in a quiet residential area. The lobby is stunning with a grand piano, marble everything, winding rod iron staircase and filled with local hand-made furniture. I was greeted by one of the owners.  She was so welcoming at the late hour.  I had requested a tour the next day and she confirmed everything for me.  I couldn't ask for a better guide.  He took my list of things I wanted to see and we did nearly everything.  His English was flawless.  It was fantastic!";
"Situated in a quiet south jakarta neighorhood, Pesona Guest House is great, comfortable and gorgeous place if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city. I stayed there because the Indonesian language courses were offered one block away at a nearby building. Easy grab bike or grab car to Cipete Raya MRT station to get to Bundaran HI, where you can take TransJakarta bus to National Monuments and Tourist attractions.";
"The warm welcome in the Beautiful decorated guesthouse of Pesona and the support in getting back our lugage made our stay unforgettable!  Thank you very much Mel, Nana and Laras.  We will tell about you in the Netherlands😊 Simon en Marry";
"I stayed here for 11 nights and it was absolutely amazing. Ibu Nana is an excellent host who is very welcoming and kind. The staff is professional and friendly. Both breakfast and dinner were delicious. The open spaces and garden have a wonderfully relaxing vibe! Next time I'm in Jakarta I will definitely stay at this guesthouse again.";
"A peaceful oasis in the midst of a heaving city. Service is wonderful, food is amazing and comes with a lovely social atmosphere encouraged not least by the friendly and boisterous proprietor. Completely different to staying in any of the regular luxury hotels for all the right reasons.";
"The most I liked was that we upgraded to Family Room, after urgent renovation has to be Done to the next room. Room space were considered VERY BIG/WIDE compare to normal hotel, so convenient for traveler with children and/or plan to have family gathering. Food during Breakfast quite OK, even though some menu were repeated (not change) for 7 days such as bread/cake. Room condition unfortunately while the space wide, need more attention on maintenance & cleanliness, since it was quite OLD already. Fortunately staff greatly response all our request of additional utilities & feedback for immediate improvement. Location luckily quite GREAT too, only around 45mins from airport & 5mins walking distance to CILANDAK TOWN SQUARE which I know the only mall that open until 2AM on";
"outdated room but still fine. we got a higher floor room but in front of our room there was a construction so the corridor become smelly. very bad. the reception is just ok. the telephone in the room is not working properly, we have tell it to reception and they said they will sent engineering to check the problem, but nobody come.... saat sore hari kami menggunakan fasilitas pool tetapi staff bolak balik di area pool sehingga membuat kami tidak nyaman, mereka seperti melihat terus ke arah kami. ada free minibar di kamar. the only thing is just because they have strategic location. Wifi di kamar juga tidak berfungsi dengan baik.";
"The room is outdated but clean. The kitchen is equipped with kitchenettes eventhough it's not complete set but still ok (no knife, no extra plates, no dishwashing liquid). The dining table is a bit old. The bathroom is outdated. No exhaust fan. Overall it's okay.";
"Thanks a lot & really appreciate for warm services especially who given by Mrs. Lela and all of her staffs since i was staying there with my family on Nov 3 to Nov 4 2019 keep it a good work.   Regards Irdam";
"A group of us went to Jakarta for a function and stayed here at the Midtown Residence. Such a wonderful location and easy to get around. We used local taxis and even central Jakarta was only a 20min cab ride away. Very reasonable prices for stay and breakfast. Pak Herman and his friendly staff made our group of 5 very welcome. Our room was well appointed with a water dispenser for drinking water as well as a kitchen and washing machine. Plenty of places to eat only a 5 minute walk away. Matahari department store and a great supermarket plus 2 levels of specialty stores at the local mall. We are definitely coming back to stay here next time we are in Jakarta. Thanks to all the staff for making us so welcome.";
"There is no maintenance at all, very dirty sheets, smelly and dusty rooms, and so called breakfast is a plate of “pasta” brought to your room. Who eats plate of cold pasta at brekfast? Even coffee or tea not served with that, forced to use instant coffee powder. Ridiculous. Go ahead and stay if you want to ruin your holiday. A total rip off. A copy paste manager email doesnt make an excuse. 🤣🤣🤣";
"My overall experience was ok. I think what most hotels fail to execute this days are the service that exceed guest expectation. Amaroossa is pretty old, but the room is big enough. Their staff were friendly, especially the security and reception. Not in the breakfast resto, there was no service at all, just saw some staff clear up and wipe the tables. Although the room is big, it needs some renovation for the aircon (noisy and need to wait several minutes to be cold enough). Food was ok, pretty complete breakfast selection. The aesthetic and authenticity factor can be improved, to make the hotel shine even its old. Hope this can be received as a constructive feedback for the hotel.";
"It probably was a luxury hotel years ago, but those times are definitely long gone. When entering the hotel, it is obvious that in order to claim “luxury”, it requires urgent upgrading & improvement.  Besides this, you’ve the highway in front of the hotel and if you’re on a higher floor, it feels as if this highway literally goes through your bedroom.  The pictures from the swimming pool must have been made from one of the best photographers in town, because there is a huge difference from what you see on the advertisements and when you physically stand in front of the pool";
"I only stayed for a short 4 days and was made welcome as I entered the reception area. My booking was attended to efficiently and my preferences attended to. The room was clean, as always and I was provided with fresh fruit on a platter. Management and supervisors were always visible, approachable and unobtrusive. I thoroughly recommend the spa services which uses trained masseurs and again, is excellent value for money. Would I return there? A firm YES";
"For now I want to reviews related our visiting 2 days ago. First, the room temperature is not cold enough.  because the maximum room temperature is only up to 27 degrees. Second, TV broadcast image quality that is less clear. The last breakfast menu that I feel the menu began to decrease if I compare about 6 months ago.  points 1 and 3 that I experience are very different from before. Thank you 🤔";
"The shower fells broken. No hot water. I cannot charge tissue until 08 Am, Air conditioner like very old. The lamp switch also broken, I just wondering about electric shock, But sofar I can enough of sleep :) the rooms like adventure to me. I hope they read this and fix it.";
"We booked a room on a (famous) booking site. It said that our reservation was guaranteed by our credit card and that check-in was until midnight. We arrived after our international flight and 1hr of taxi, at 10 PM. On arrival, the staff tells us that he cancelled the room at 7 PM after trying to reach us (we were in a plane) because he didn't hear from us (even though, again, check-in until midnight and credit card guarantee). We ask for a room anyways but the hotel is full. We ask if our entire stay has been cancelled and he says yes. So, at 10 PM, we have to find another place to stay. We did (Hotel 88 up the street, great service).   At the end of our stay in this other hotel (3 nights), we discover that they charged us for the 3 nights that they supposedly cancelled";
"Strategic location near the Haji Nawi MRT station but it doesn't maximize this advantage with better service. Stains on the wall, dirty carpet, no towel, no window, disfunctioning card. Need to fix and touch up your interior design";
"In my opinion the Maven Fatmawati hotel is a fairly comfortable hotel, compared to other Maven Hotels, with rooms that are quite spacious, with affordable prices that are really suitable for those of you who are looking for a hotel with low budget, plus a check in process and check out. quite fast with excellent service from receptiont ramadan. Thanks for giving me excellent service. I will return to your hotel. See you on my next visit.";
"It placed in fatmawati near blok m and there’s construction in front of the hotel so it kinda hidden from the main road. When I was there I got the only room left with very noisy air conditioning. For breakfast you will get fresh the chef gonna cook it for you. But only choose from 2 menu only. Maybe when the hotel full booked they’ll provide buffe";
"Not much to say. It's a small hotel with limited facilities but we are happy with what we got. Near the big road. Easy to find. The biggest problem will be a parking space. It's clean! What suprise me was they provide kitchen and a medium size refrigerator at the room. So if you need a room in the city for longer stay with family, you should consider the hotel.";
"We stayed here for one night and it was very comfort. There was mini pantry in our room, it was superior time. And it was very helpful when you brought toddlers with you on your trip to Jakarta. The price was really worth it and I would like to come back again someday. Keep the good cleanliness.";
