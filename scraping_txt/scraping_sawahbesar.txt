Good service and a place to stay to get to the airport quickly. 20 mins walk to Mangga Dua Square where there is a Carrefour Transmart Hypermarket located.

"Grand Hyatt should be the grandest of all Hyatt property. In Jakarta, this property is iconic and located above the luxury Plaza Indonesia Mall and facing the Bundaran HI. I really had very high expectation about this hotel.   The lobby is grandeur and huge. Check in was no hassle, I book the night from Traveloka during their flash sale, so I had a very good rate.   The room itself is large and spacious. But it's just not luxurious and seems old. The bathroom is small, but it has bathtub. What disappointed me the most are the bed. I booked twin bed and stay with my friend. But the twin bed configuration is not really twin bed. It's more like double bed split in the middle. There's no space among the 2 beds, literally sticks to each other. The design is not well thought and";

"Two issues with this hotel:  1) air-conditioning doesn't cool the room that much. Are their air-conditioning units properly maintained or are they set to not cool below a certain temperature to save on electricity costs?  2) the cigarette smoke stench inside was the room was quite unbearable. I specifically requested non-smoking but still the room was stinky.";
"location was ok but only towel and soap were given there was no dental kit. I was disappointed with the choice of breakfast there were no bread all. And they were doing  nothing to offer. So what for the breakfast was included but the fact was nothing. what a bad experience.";

It is a near from cetral Jakarta.  They have restaurant and roof top. In total is ok and can try to stay here when visit jakarta alone or with couple to stay.  Room is comfortbale.

"We stayed in Heef Hotel for one night and everything was good. The lady at the Reception was really helpful and kind.  This hotel is strategically located opposite Passer Baroe, a place to go if you're looking into buying Musical Instruments or just tasting the local food. There's a stretch or market where you can buy things from non-branded slippers, bags, dresses and wigs!  The hotel breakfast was simple but tasted good. They had a choice of local breakfast which is rice, a main dish, some vegetables and keropok. Then, they served Koko Krunch, Bread, Coffee, Tea and Fruits! Good enough.  We're planning to come back again very soon.";

"Booked this hotel because from the flash sale of an online travel ecommerce. The protocol was being applied. The security checked our body temperature. The front office staff aren't really friendly, but they were very clear on telling the regulation and hotels details. the old vibes are very strong felt in the elevator, the keycard was'nt for tapped, instead we needed to slide inside the machine. The room is good, very clean, no strange odor. The bathroom is okay, the amenities just okay. At that time, the kids were disappointed because the pool was closed. According to the staff, it was closed due to Covid-19. So we were just spending the time at the room.";

"I stayed two nights here with my wife in February 2019. I like the hotel, but the English skills of staff were lacking but with my Bahasa skills we were fine. Plus this is a hotel where locals stay, so you come to expect it. The staff was very friendly. The room was nice with a king sized bed. The bed was a little hard for me, but this is the norm in Indonesia. Other than my wife there was only one other foreigner staying at the hotel, which I do not mind. I would stay here again when passing through Jakarta.";
"the room good enough, and service was good . breakfast food tasty i like it . but i don't like the pool next to bar, it was weird while you swim there was people eating and hang out and you can't do cannonball in the pool hahaha .";
"We stayed here our last two nights on a 5-week trip.  After a lot of budget hotels with more broken than fixed things it was very comfortable to come here and sleep in spotless linen, with working lights and no furniture broken or damaged.  The swimming pool is also very nice after a hot day of sightseeing. A bit weird though that the pool area is more or less in the restaurant.  Very friendly and helpful staff.   When we stated here, they were renovating on our floor so the hallways had a very bad, chemical smell. But that had no effect in the rooms, you only smelled it when you got out.";
"Hotel is recomend for traveller, easy to reach. But if do you want good breakfast, you will dissapointed. Only bread and a cup a coffee only. So you must prepare breakfast youself. But overall is good.";
"What can I say..  Front desk, ladies were friendly, Men were not friendly. Houskeeping staffs were hanging out and chit chat loudly while doing their jobs  and I could hear their conversation clearly inside the room. aircon was not cold at all, and hotel gave me room which was so noisy, there was a construction work on the next building, while I have requested quiet room when booking. Lots and lots of mosquitoes everywhere in the lobby, hallway, room. i could not sleep at all. Breakfast is poor. Only one bread with tea/coffee. Nothing else. Location, to pasar pagi 15-25mns walk, to itc 10mns walk. No restaurants nearby  you should go to itc for food. The good things were cleanliness  and a comb in a toilettries bag. Securities were friendly too (although quite busybody asking me";
"This hotel is a recommended one if you want to stay at a good hotel with affordable price. It's very near to the ITC Mangga 2, you just need to walk for a few minutes. It is next to a 24 hour store, and there are many local cafes/shops that sell good local food nearby. I really enjoyed staying there.";
"this property located very near the mangga dua mall, only 5 minutes walk. However if you want to go to other shopping area like Thamrin, Tanah Abang or Pasar Baru need to take taxi or other type of transportation. It cost around 30,000 - 50,000 RP by taking Blue Bird taxi. Staffs were very polite and respect each guest. Overall hotel was ok except that the Wifi was unavailable for almost 2 days and TV reception was out for 1 day. That really turned us off.";
"Clean & tidy room, staff is very helpfull. I will suggest to my friend and family if went to Jakarta. Near with Pasar Pagi mangga 2 Dua and infront hotel have night market. Can shopping there. Overall im satisfied. Good hospitality keep it up üëçüèª";

The room is very spacious and clean. Talking about the food, we went for breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. Every time we had food and drinks is always delicious. We tried the BEST pempek in Jakarta , and beef pindang, nasi tampan set, cost 88k. It's fantastic for all of us. I cannot how delicious the food was is just incredible in our mouth and tummy.

"We booked this hotel for my birthday because every site says it has a pool. First they tried to tell me there is no pool, only a jacuzzi. Then I showed them the photo and they said it is men only. They refused to give me a refund. No we have a hotel for 5 nights that does not allow women to use all the facilities.";
"We stayed there in this April for one night. Staff service was excellent, they were really helpful. specially Micheal and Ninik. They have free breakfast buffet with really delicious foods. I highly recommend this place.";
"Drinks are reasonable, Heineken beer will cost 125k including tax. Service is good  You get what you pay for It‚Äôs a good for one time visit  Ground floor, second floor and fifth floor has club  Second floor service is better. But beware of ladies drink.";
"The hotel located in Central Jakarta, near to Food district, i.e. Mangga Besar & Pecenongan.  Wide parking lot, various menu of breakfast, Proactive staff, and Complete nightlife entertainment (club, karaoke, lounge, spa, etc).  When many Travel search engine put this hotel with 4 star, I want to put only 3.5 star, cause some facility in this hotel slighly old. But overall, I want still to visit this hotel in the future.";
