"This hotel is really great! I was booking for 3 nights for my staycation honeymoon, the facilities is great, the location was great it's near to the shopping spot. The breakfast was quite good, but i was expecting more from 4 star hotel if i compare with other hotel. But for the hotel staff service is really good, even when we ask for several stuff and quite often they always serve us passionately. I'm really recommend this hotel if you want to do staycation.  Thx yuan garden!";

"Stayed here for one night only. The room was spacious, neat and super clean. Due to pandemic I made sure I cleaned everything before I touch. I cleaned the table with alcohol and tissue, and I found no dust whatsoever, it's super clean. Very impressive. Bathroom was nice, and the soap and shampoo smells really great, wish I bumped into the cleaner's cart so I could take one or two of them! :D Breakfast was nice, nothing fancy, perhaps they reduced the option due to pandemic, but it's totally fine. One little bummer during my stay, I asked for 1 bed, instead they gave me room with 2 beds, except for that everything else is good.";
"Everything in this Hotel is cool.. I love to stay there.. The breakfast condiments was perfect, fresh, and the taste so good.. They still have a lot of condiments in breakfast even the occupancy low.. We will back soon..";
"Stayed there for a short vacation in Jakarta. Check-in location is the same as Harris Vertue, incl. the breakfast venue (I think it's due to COVID). Room was nice and spacious, and (again) I think it was Harris' as well. Breakfast menu variation was quite limited but tasted good. I enjoyed 'nasi goreng ikan asin'. Lots of restaurants nearby, eg. Ta Wan, Raa Cha (at the same building as the hotel, ie. Harmoni Exchange). Or you can walk outside to some other restaurants also close by, eg. Dunkin Donuts, Eatlah, A&W, etc. You won't starve! Thanks Yello :)";
"Located in Central Jakarta and with many infamous food stall/ restaurant within a mile. Surely this hotel is a good choice for who love to eat in their holiday. I booked the suite type for two days and i am amazed when entering the room because it is bigger than the picture i saw in website or tripadvisor reviews. The suite type is like apartment that has a living room with office desk, and minibar. And the other side is bedroom with another tv. Also it has a big windows with a great view, mine got north jakarta view, we can see jakarta sea when there‚Äôs no haze (i hoped got the monas view before i checked in but unfortunately it already fully booked lol). But it‚Äôs okay since i only got to pay half price ( i got the deal from some OTA‚Äôs flash sale). The next day i just realized";
"Such a nice stay as i was upgraded to Harris vertu when im booking with Yello rates. Been staying many times in Vertu in the past and this time would like to try Yello to know why this hotel rated full 5 in Tripadvisor rating. But the fact im upgraded to Harris makes this trip even better.  Harris vertu is one of the best Harris i have ever stayed (been staying in Bali-jakarta-bandung-surabaya-solo-semarang-malang). Vertu is superior in every aspect, room cleanliness, design, room comfort and many other aspect.   Next time will try their Yello tho, im cusrious to stay at top rated hotel in Tripadvisor.";

"Hotel Santika Slipi is one of my fave hotel to staycation. The hotel location is very strategic, because it's close to mall, such as Mal Taman Anggrek, Central Park, Grand Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, and Senayan City.  It is also suites for family with children, becase it has a large swimming pool. Children would love it.  The breakfast buffet also has various of menus. And inside the restaurant, there's a children play room, so you don't have to worry if your children a little bit grumpy.  The room is quite big for Deluxe and Superior Type, neat, clean, no carpet, and have a long sofa.  Next to the hotel, there's also padang Restaurant " Sederhana " and Indomaret for your first help :)";

Room are clean and spacious. Morning breakfast spread is wonderful. You can choose between local dishes and some simple western breakfast. Highly recommended if you're looking for hotel which is  value for money.";
"First, I tried to reach the hotel by phone, but the number written on google and OTA is NOT the actual hotel number, it's the head office number. So, they redirected me to another number. Annoying. I checked in to the hotel late at 23.00, there the reception was very good, quick and informative, bravo Mr. Teguh! Then, another trouble happened. Both the key card were not working properly. I gotta inserted the card couple of times to make it works. Got my room at 1605, the room is very spacious, the view is amazing, the bath tub is awesome, until I found the thick dust on the mirror's frame. It's not like a day or two of not being wiped, it's like a whole month. The next morning, I had an amazing breakfast at JP Bistro. Thank you Mr. Hendru who was very responsive to clean up the";
"Urging Tripadvisor to remove or deactivate pool and gym activities as available in this hotel. At least after being otherwise confirmed by Aryaduta. I am really DISAPPOINTED and felt misleaded as the listed facilities are closed due to hotel policy. No solutions offered by the front desk as we basically understand that many other hotels actually open its pool and gym. In bahasa: tolong dihilangkan keterangan fasilitas kolam renang dan gym di hotel ini karena meskipun ada tapi sengaja ditutup. Hal ini terjadi pada hari ini, Sabtu 25 Juli 2020. Tolong dilakukan agar customer tidak salah dalam memesan..";

"The building may look a bit old but the rooms are spacious and comfortable. With a proximity to the National Monument and Gambir Railway station and many attractions the hotel makes a good choice, especially so because it is not located on a main road yet accessible easily from main roads.  Rooms are clean and sleep quality is good. Staff are helpful and the King's Cafe down below is a 24 / 7 facility. A place where they coax you to try different food items in quite a warm manner.  A good stay indeed. And they offer free drop at Gambir Station if one so desires.";
"Great hotel and great services from all the hotel staff. The hotel was located a bit far from a ‚Äúlive‚Äù location but it is so lovely to stay here. No noise from crowd, simple but great foods for breakfast, and the most they are friendly and helpful. They have a free shuttle heading to Tanah Abang so you need to worry. MoNas is just a stone throw from this hotel. Around 15 minutes by walking distance. The foods for in-room-dining are cheap and affordable. Much much love from all of us.";

"It was my first stay in Fave Hotel Tanah Abang. When I stayed there it was quiet, I think the occupancy may not be good due to pandemic.  All staffs wore PPE and I had temperature check before entered the lobby. The room was clean, quite small but comfortable. I like the room. Staffs I met were also friendly.  During the pandemic restaurant and room service was only until 6 pm. So I had early dinner then. The food was good. The only minor thing in my opinion was the parking area which was very limited. But luckily they had valet parking which was free.";

However, no access to terrace and main coach / sofas at the living room should be replaced  as they are not clean, and look dirty to use them.  Reception area and restaurant / breakfast normal.  Pool normal. Not comfortable furniture to enjoy a relaxing time.";

"Swimming pool was not clean (as well as windows), air conditioner too loud (all the time), grey towels, dirty sinks in bathroom. Poor customer service, awful hotel decor.  But: Good massage in Spa center, good Chinese food in the restaurant, good WiFi.  Overall, definitely not a 5 star hotel, 2-3 max. Location is not central and far from events/venues/interesting places";
"It was quite a nice stay. Very friendly personal and a comfort room with everything you need. Big bed inside and a nice bathroom. Downstairs is a little restaurant where you can have some food or just drink something. Would like to stay another night when I go back to Jakarta! :)";

In the lobby is connecting with Padang Restaurant and in front of the hotel theres Starbucks that wich is good for you to hang out or just take a coffee. So yeaah overall the place, the staff and the place is really good";
"To whom it my concern,  I feel satisfied staying at the Maxone hotel.  The rooms are comfortable and always cleaned every day, the staff are friendly, the response is fast when needed, breakfast is varied.  Everything is ok, so there is no reason not to stay at this hotel again when traveling.  One more thing is that its strategic location, close to Starbucks and Padang's food restaurant which is open 24 hours, and close to the busway stop makes it easy for me to hang out while working and makes it easy for me to do activities with public transport.  Thus the results of my review during a stay at the Maxone Platinum Hotel (16-26 Feb 2020).  Br, -Wiwien-";

"Located just behind the padang merdeka resto and . there some choice for restaurant, and also supermarket and convenient store within a walking distance, since traffic jams are common in the area. The room are not big but clean and tidy, too bad the quilt a bit damp during our first night, we ask for a change the nex day and the new one is Ok.   The bathroom are clean, but the ventilation fan is not strong enough to suck the steam during a shower and the steam made the cool room tiles wet all over, and that's unpleasant situation.  The readily available slipper in the room is only a pair, even though the room is intended for two guest.";
"The interior is all great based on the rent price. I also have no problem with the cleanliness as well.   But, I am experiencing a full of unpleasant experiences even within 1 hour after I checked in!   First of all, a group of people can enter to inside my room based on their keys! Phewm, fortunately I am still fully clothed and not taking a bath. This family said that they were given the wrong keys by the receptionist.  Next, my Air-Con is not working well. The room was very hot. At the beginning, I thought it's happening in all rooms until I saw a housekeeper cleaning a room in front of mine and realized this room is quite cool.   Then, I asked the receptionist to change the room and they said the hotel was fully booked for double bed and all guests have checked in.  Wow,";
"The room is not bad and clean although it is rather hot (or the AC is working poorly). The mattress is good, but the bed is too short for a tall person like  me (1.90). What I really dislike about this place is the loudness of the music at breakfast. It seems you are attending a disco, rather than having breakfast. Even the music on the corridor to the room is that loud that it irritates you when at your room. What is the point of it? Does the hotel wants it quests to be awake?";
"Many times had stayed in this hotel. The location was perfect in the heart of business and government area. The breakfast was so tasty with typically Indonesian traditional foods, though they also served international food. The front desk staffs were so nice and helpful to handle any circumstances of my requests. Perfect for a long or short business stay!";

"I would like to share my experience staying in Ibis Styles Jakarta Gajah Mada which took place in early December last year. I decided to stay in this hotel since I had an early morning appointment to attend the next day in CBD area of Jakarta.   Since I had stayed in Ibis Jakarta Harmoni the week before, I decided to stay in this particular hotel property. The hotel had confirmed that they would prepare my room for early check-in that day. However, since I had to finish some work prior to checking in the hotel, I arrived in the hotel around noon that day.  Check-in was prompt and efficient. Within 10 minutes, I have entered my suite room which was located in the 7th floor (Room 708). The room was huge (bigger than most rooms we can find in any Ibis or Ibis Styles), clean and";

"On the upside, the bedroom given to me was spacious. The air-conditioning system worked perfectly well. The breakfast was excellent with variety of choices (Continental, Javanese, Indonesian). The room service was unbelievably fast and efficient. - On the downside, the hotel lobby on Saturday night was very stressful as there were many wedding guests lounging around. Some of the children were noisy with parents showed no interest in teaching their children better manners in hotel lobby area. It would be good if hotel staff members can remind the noisy people (children and/or adults) to quiet down, and be a little bit more considerate to other hotel guests. Just a thought.";
"Located just behind Gaja Madah mall, there is an easy back door access. Room comfortable and large enough. Unfortunately, the toilet leaked on the floor and they couldn't fix it. There were too many mozzies at the lobby and in the restaurant. I had to get some repellent which helped but it was irritating.";
"Thank you for the friendly staff and impressive service during my trip in Jakarta. The location of the hotel is pretty strategic to the business area in Tana Abang, Abdul Muis and Gambir..
