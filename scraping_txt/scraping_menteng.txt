"From the beginning while entering the Hotel Indonesia Kempinski building, we felt the warmth welcome from the hotel staff. The elegance and luxury of the interior also makes the feeling soar. Service at the front office is fast and pleasant. Likewise when entering my spacious and luxurious room. When entering the bathroom area, you can feel the luxury of this hotel, a large bathtub and a very luxurious closet that is fully automatic. Toiletries are very complete, and unlike other hotels that limit drinking water for guests, here we are offered to add drinking water if it feels not enough. Giant towels, it is sometimes troublesome to use because they are heavy. The small thing that feels lacking is writing tools, if at the Apurva, Kempinski, Bali it is equipped with beautiful";

"Hotel Indonesia Kempinksi has just popped up into my mind when I think where to spend my special day. Providing spacious room with bathtub and exquisite food, Hotel Indonesia Kempinski was welcoming me with unforgettable birthday wish.  However, it would be nice if in the future this hotel also provide music player, so that we, as a guest, are able to enjoy the staycation as nowadays people are rarely watching television.";
"As a discovery black member, this is my favorite place to stay when i go to Jakarta. Its near Grand Indonesia Shopping Mall.. and The OKU Restourant is a must try when you stay there. The staff and the manager are friendly. I stay more than 20 nights this year.. so far i have excellent experience.. even sometimes the hotels have troubles, but the staff manage troubles quickly, and give me compensation.   So its a 5/5 star hotel experience.";
"We stayed as a family with toddler (1.5 years) for 3 nights in Oriental Suite Room.  The room was huge (95 sqm) consisted of livingroom and bedroom with a huge bathroom. We could feel that the room was quite old but nevertheless still classy and well maintained. The furniture and bedding were top notch, no complain whatsoever in that regards.  The bathroom amenities were Acqua Di Parma which was one of our favorite, and to our surprise, by staying in a suite we got the big bottles which is very satisfying.   Of course the main advantage of getting room at Mandarin Oriental Jakarta was the view and what a view it was! We got two vistas, one overlooking the welcome monument and the other Jalan Sudirman. For the price it offered, we believe Mandarin will give you the best bang for";
"We stayed for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary and was pleasantly delighted.  - We were delighted by the anniversary decoration that was prepared beforehand. There were balloons, banners, bed decorations and cakes prepared - We stayed during COVID pandemic with our almost 2 year old daughter but is pleased with the COVID prevention. There were hand sanitizers, room were sealed after disinfected. Pool and breakfast restaurant is limited using periodic slots. Food is still buffet style but served and taken by the waiters so it is safer. - The room itself is facing the HI fountain and was great view  - An improvement that maybe I can give is that the amount of waiters might be insufficient to serve everyone (we dined at Lifeng as well), probably because of layoffs and cutoffs due to";
"As always always always. Never disappointing.. this has been my more than 3 times stays ib this past 3 months in MO, and we even planned to stay here again in the next month. Even in this pandemic situation they keep safety protocols first. Such as in room breakfast to avoid crowd in the restaurant, queueing system for the gym and swinng pool facility, it's not easy but they managed to do it well, we always feel safe during our stay in MO. Btw if you're planning to bring your bicycle, they will also let you put it in the concierge. Best experience always. Thank you MO.";

Everything was set up perfectly, They were the one who planned everything with the decor team without me having to feel worry. The service was over the top, I even requested VIP treatment for certain tables and they still wing it with the small crews.  Not only for my guests, they also served the crew like MC and photographer on my behalf, which I am super thankful for.

I guess all the rooms has big window ... so you can enjoy great view from the room. amenities were quite good .. my daughter loves the room. as we stayed in pandemic situation, the room were sanitized well and .. its really clean.  This hotel served breakfast which is packed in bento box. the box inside was rice with chicken, scrambled egg, veggies and fruits. It looks yummy ... but we usually didn't take rice in the morning. so sorry we have to leave the remaining food.  For suggestion, I guess its better to make breakfast optional  and ask to the guest when they check in since .. not all the";
"The location of course! The hotel is clean also. I slept in superior room, basic but all you need is there. Staffs are friendly, the security, the receptionists, the housekeeper did also their job very good. Special credit for Inggrit at the reception. She gives excellent service: always serve with smile although i know some guests are intimidative, and she greets me always by name. She is an asset for the hotel!";
"One of the most important thing especially during this time is super clean room! Ashley offers great room with a great services, they also sealed each door with sticker to make sure & show the guests that they already did special treat to ensure guests safety.

"We stayed over the weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Stayed at the penthouse (president suites). It was very delightful. In my holiday, I almost never stayed at standard room (more than 90%), and this stay, was extra ordinary. The staffs are super. Very sincere and the hospitality shown, is top notch flaw less. The experiences was started even before we checked in, even before I upgrade the room. The staff help me "smuggled" the flowers, our wedding pictures and disinfectant them then put them in the suite. They also added some decoration. Ms Kenny, Ms Aurora and Mr Arief were helping me during the surprise preparation.  During the stay, all are superb. The service, hospitality, sincerity all at the highest standard. They even well arranged the taxi for my morning";

Security is top notch. The bedding was delightful. We found it to be centrally locates and across the street from a train stop on the local transportation. This hotel is 100 % accessible.";
"1. Great service from the staff. Specially the FO(Ms Aurora thanks for the cookies and Ms Milla), Concierge, pool, and waiters who delivered my food. Also the doorman, security and the other staff.  2. Great taste for the food (beside bf, I also ordered for lunch and dinner) but maybe you need put a pen or pencil for writing in bf card before hanging in front of the door.  3. The room cleanliness, very good.  4. Wi-Fi connection need more improvement, more fast I think.  5. The pool? Fyi, if you want to swimming at the pool. You need booked first at concierge, because the pool allowed only 57 pax due to social distancing.  Overall, 9,5 for your score. Thanks for your services üòä";

"Artotel is just like its name. The room interior is minimalist, industrial type and full of art. Very nice, cozy, and suitable for honeymoon, babymoon or staycation with family. The location is also strategic, it's across Sarinah Thamrin, near Jl. Sabang. The neighbourhood is full of restaurant, there's Hongkong Cafe, Bakmi GM, Total Fruit Store, and Pisa Cafe. You can just walk to reach there. And if you stay on the weekend, you can easily join the car free day every Sunday morning.";
"I knew Artotel for its artsy experience as well as good hospitality for a competitive price.  For the record, this is a long due review. Hopefully things already better now.  First of all, it is a common understanding that check-in time is at 2 PM or the latest by 3 PM. By the time I arrived at 4 PM, surprisingly receptionist informed me that the room wasn't ready.  Another note on the reception staff, I was not being greeted like any normal hotel staffs would do when guests arriving at the premise. Maybe he was tired, no smile at all.  Fortunately, it didn't take a long wait for us to check-in into our room.  When I entered the room. It was okay, but the cleaning wasn't thorough. I spotted several area covered in dust a bit and a bit of litter around table near the window.";
"It was my second visit (the first one was in late May 2018). I booked the Studio 20 unit for a night, just like my first visit. However, this time I asked for a room with a double bed instead of twin beds. The interior was, as expected, artsy and funky. The furniture items were great and the working chair made a twist to my visit (due to its shape, I thought the chair was broken but it was just the structure). Having a room on the 6th floor, I could enjoy a better view this time. However, TV channels disappeared a couple of times and I had to turn the TV off to get them back. The bathroom was just fine. No objection.   The check-in process was quick and easy. Staff members were helpful, especially the front-liners. I also visited BART to have some drinks and this time, the staff";

"Room‚Ä®‚Ä®  We were staying in 1 bedroom executive unit facing north with Monumen Nasional view. The room includes a small kitchen with basic cooking utensils and laundry machine in the bathroom with a bathtub. Even though we were enjoying our stay, I think there are still room for improvements There are some minor stains on the wallpapers, lacking of power outlet can be a challenge, there were mold inside their double pane glass which is ruining the view, and the bathtub drain was not working (management team quickly fixed this for us).‚Ä®‚Ä®  Note that although the north side have a better view, it is also facing a bright large LCD billboard that runs all day and night, if you are sensitive to light you might want to consider other views.  ‚Ä®Location‚Ä®‚Ä®  Getting into the hotel can be a";

"I had a short staycation here but the experience were great enough in a cheap and small hotel like Erian (despite the location in Menteng). I booked at midnight and checked in at 3 a.m. but the staff was helpful and fast so I could rest as soon as i came. Room was good. But might be too small if family staycation was your intention. Didn't try the breakfast because i had to checkout early in the morning.";
"The hotel is very clean and fragrant, all the staffs (even the securities and technicians!) are very friendly and proactive. The breakfast are delicious. What I admire most are they provide water in glass bottle, and they provide bicycles to stroll around. Keep up the great job.";
"Stay there for 3 days with my family. Book family room, the room is very big, nice minimalist design, lots of tv channel, nice bathroom, complete amenities. All of the staff is very friendly and professional. Breakfast is very good, lots of varieties and taste good. They have meeting rooms and rooftop bar is under construction, cant wait to see the rooftop bar. Keep up the good work.";
"I was looking for somewhere fairly central to stay in Jakarta. Menteng is a good option, and the Erian deserves its good reviews. It‚Äôs modern, spotlessly clean and well managed.   The room was comfortable. Nice touches like hand towels, decent toiletries, refillable drinking water. There‚Äôs a safe and the aircon works well. Good WiFi. Only one thing missing really - a hair dryer would be useful.  Breakfast was better than I expected, with enough choices and variation to stop you getting bored.";
"Having come from a horrible hotel in Medan, Sumatra, the Erian Hotel was a treat. Our room was simply furnished and quite small but was really clean, with a great bathroom.   We were only here for one night, and I was looking forward to breakfast. There appeared to be a lot of choice but there wasn‚Äôt much available. It wasn‚Äôt until I‚Äôd had a couple of croissants that a lady appeared outside and began cooking omelettes, sadly it was time to leave and I missed out.";

Thank you Grand Hyatt for your amazing service with amazing promotional rate. Stay safe and keep healthy!";

"Grand Hyatt should be the grandest of all Hyatt property. In Jakarta, this property is iconic and located above the luxury Plaza Indonesia Mall and facing the Bundaran HI. I really had very high expectation about this hotel.   The lobby is grandeur and huge. Check in was no hassle, I book the night from Traveloka during their flash sale, so I had a very good rate.   The room itself is large and spacious. But it's just not luxurious and seems old. The bathroom is small, but it has bathtub. What disappointed me the most are the bed. I booked twin bed and stay with my friend. But the twin bed configuration is not really twin bed. It's more like double bed split in the middle. There's no space among the 2 beds, literally sticks to each other. The design is not well thought and";

"Spent one night here in their newly renovated Grand Deluxe room. Check in process was quick and safe with health protocols applied. The room size was small, if you see from outside the building, one window equals one room. Though small, the newly renovated room was quite nice and comfortable, somehow eliminates the feeling that this is and old hotel.  This hotel already opened the swimming pool for guests, but the other facilities remain closed commonly after the pandemic is over. It's location is strategically located in middle of everything. Food orders and delivery from outside were so cheap and easy.  The breakfast was what disappoints me. Practically no safe distance between tables. The food quality was mediocre with very little choices. We didn't spend our time long during";
"The location of this hotel is very strategic.  Right in the middle of business and entertainment area in Jakarta. The building is old enough but classy elegant. I suggest u to choose grand deluxe room for staying in this hotel.  It's a new renovated room with modern interior and equipment. But too bad there is no bathtube in this type of room. They have many facilities such as gym,  swimming pool,  and spa.  But u have to check it first to front desk, because some facilities have adjustment regulation during the pandemi. The breakfast is ok.  Need more variety but the taste is good enough.  The staff also helpfull and friendly.";
