"Gran Mahakam was the hotel I was going prior to the pandemic when I wanted to enjoy a great breakfast. This time, the breakfast was awful.  In my opinion, we value a service not when everything is going well but when the hotel still does its best to maintain the standard when the situation is hard. In Gran Mahakam failed in this. Instead of trying to do its best to remain a reference, they tried to save money where they shouldn't.  A very bad point for me. Moreover when we knot that the room in Gran Mahakam, compared to the value, are not the best in the city. No point to pay 1 million IDR for this night. Sorry for this bad review because the worker are still very kind.";
"I stayed at this hotel because of my cousin's wedding. It has a quiet big room, very suitable for families. The room has elegant room interior, has thick and cozy carpet, with big furniture.  My children very comfortable stayed in here.";
"I stayed with my husband for a short escape. Best hotels for families and couples, since it's comfortable enough and very homey. Love the interior, restaurant, and pool. Nice food and services. We reserved the suite room and it was all satisfied.";
"First time being here was back then during my Grandma's birthday in 2007. Back then the meal was spectacular. They have the most amazing Indonesian dish in my opinion. Over the time I came back again in 2010, 2018 for friend's wedding and just now, March 15 2020. We had special request of Japanese menu, crab handroll wrapped in edamame sheet, amazing! Their Nasi Combrang is also worth to try and of course their tasty dimsum. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming, from valet to restaurant staffs, all of them are very welcoming. If you're looking for good brunch or dinner, Gran Mahakam is the right place in South Jakarta.";
"Gran Mahakam has been kind of second home for my family and we‚Äôre going to this place regularly for special occasions: NYE, birthday dinner, or any other occasions. The staff(s) are very welcoming and helpful. We were once here for staycation too and it was lovely experience :) def recommended hotel!";
"Stayed there for 1 night in room 217, the room view was the street and transjakarta stop. The sound from the street, exhaust pipe of motorcycles and cars can be heard from our room, which annoying part.  The staffs were very friendly and helpful.  Requested the upper floor, unfortunately not available.  The room was nice, bed was comfortable, pillows as well, all the light use warm white style. The bathroom was nice but still need more repairs on the ceramic near shower.  Parking was a bit difficult for indoor but there are a lot of spaces for outdoor.";

"This is my 3rd time I stay in the hotel. I tried many other hotels before & I must say I like this hotel. Good rate for business traveler who just want to have a good rest at night.   The choices of breakfast is quite a lot compare to others &  quality of the food üëç. They have a Japanese restaurant which is also very nice.   I don‚Äôt have the chance to try/use the other facilities but the room is almost perfect. Sound proof. Nice bed. AC works great. I like the long & wide table that I can put many stuff there but only 1 power outlet near the table. Hot & cold shower with fine spray. This is important.  Surely I will go back to this hotel.";

"What I'd really like about this hotel is late check-out at 3pm.  The room quite spacious and there is comfy sofas on deluxe room.  The staffs also very helpful and nice.  The breakfast is simple, but tastes good.  The minus is this premises located near traditional market, sometimes the bad smells came into lobby.";

"Just visited Ambhara hotel for short getaway last night. Arrive at 08:00 p.m. my plan was to grab a quick dinner and then go to sleep, but the interior design of the hotel made me wandering around. And about the room, I don't know what fragrance they use but it's sooo relaxing and I really really love it!. üòá  I told you about the design right? Check out the wardrobe pic I took, it's so majestic! Made me think of it as one of that Narnian door. üòÜ  At 07:30 a.m. I'm about to leave the hotel and I received a heartwarming check out service by Miss Widya. I mean all the staffs are super friendly, they'll greet you in a nice gesture and all. But Miss Widya is different, you can see her smile and sincerity even though she's wearing a face mask! Someone's eyes really can tell a lot I";

"Ambhara Hotel Jakarta is on top of my mind when it comes to an event. On this special occasion of my past birthday, I want to rejoice with my friends in a cozy place along with the broad menu they offer that we're craving for.   I also want to acknowledge the following people who've helped us out to have this experience, Bu Dina (Director of Sales & Marketing) and the staffs, Lovy, Dian and 2 kitchen trainees for their attentive services.

"I stayed there for 1 nights in 21st Oct 2020. This hotel is strategic, near from everywhere, especially when you have meeting in South area of Jakarta. Lobby looks fine and clean. The staff are also friendly. I haven't seen even a single seat table chair at the lobby, so you really don‚Äôt want to wait for anyone here upon check in or check out. I was given a room #3344. The room are quite large and clean. Even though I had a problem with the room at the first time, luckily Rina the receptionist and the engineering staff that I forgot the name was very helpful and indulgent, she was fast and sincere, when I needed so many things.";
"So far good, if your trip is to enjoy the hotel and can have access to malls, cafes and good. restaurants nearby, a perfect choice to stay.  However, in terms of service could do better. The guest service supposed to be an excellent service, however need to improve in their human resource. - how to treat customers better.";
"We love the pillow and the bed, bathrobe. Very comfy. I wonder where to buy it. I really want to have one :). The staff and the service was excellent. I love my short anniversary staycation. I will come back for sure!!!!";
"Amazing location and city view. Located at Sudirman Central business fistrict, prime location in Jakarta. Simple, Modern, & minimalist design with contemporer art instalation. The service was great. There are 3 restaurant (vong kitchen, le burger and hakkasan at the rooftop). Near pacific place shopping mall and idx tower. They have amazing pool view with jacuzzi. I really love alilla's pajama towel, that's really cool.";
"Despite they only have 3 types of rooms, almost all rooms on 1 floor have different sizes. If you book xl studio and allocated room ending with #10, it's one of the smalllest room they have and has no work area. This is very strange because even the studio room has work area. The only reason they sell it as a xl studio instead of studio king is because the bathroom has a bath tub. Even if this room is sold as a studio, it didn't even fulfil the standard because all the rooms are advertised equipped with work area.  Appreciate the team allocated me to another room which is one of the biggest room for xl studio. The guest experience manager also came up with a souvenir and card when I check out. However, first impression does matter and it wasn't a good one. It somehow ruins our";
"Best hotel in the city with a nice staff & good services. Having a birthday such a wonderful time in there . Also it‚Äôs very easy to access to mall Pasific place . Having dinner & breakfast just by walk ..";
"Spent a few days here, its a nice hotel in terms of look and feel. A heritage look with many unique and traditional touches which would be interesting for people from other countries.  The room was decently sized for 2 persons, a very spacious shower area which was so big you could swing a cat, even a dog in it. On the other hand the toilet was small and if you were sitting down, you would need to swing aside to close the door. Minor details.  Nice capsule style coffee machine, standard bottles of water and a very nice toiletries set designed by an Australian company called Apothecary. Great scents.   The room air-conditioning was not functioning well tho, even after being re-booted, it worked well for a few hours and then it was back to being warm and not cool. Not sure if its";
"stayed here to celebrate our anniversary 2 weeks ago, a week before we checked in, we request to have a decoration in the room. the decoration is just a standard one, and they also sent us a piece of cake as a complimentary. We dont have chance to breakfast in SOFIA since it was closed for hotel guest, too bad. my highlight is the breakfast option. since they dont serve buffet breakfast, so they offer us 1 meal only ( ala carte ) menu. a bit disappointed because we pay for a good rate to stay there. i have nasi goreng, and they waitress said if we want to have another menu, they'll charge us. too bad.";
"So pretty! Not the largest or most practical hotel (there is barely enough room to put toiletries or space in room to hang clothes), but I would stay again just because it's so nice to come back to an aesthetically pleasing room after a long day. Staff was also very pleasant.  The breakfast is pretty lousy, it's a la carte and not tasty at all. Couldn't finish my breakfast.  In spite of its shortcomings I would still stay again. Not recommended if you are a very practical person though.";
"Great alternative to usual boring business hotels. More homely, warm and nice colonial historical feel. Rooms ok if small and restaurant downstairs (Sofia) is good for both breakfast and dinner. Staff nice and friendly if at times a bit forgetful. Slightly let down by noisy aircon and at times things get forgotten (replenishing room supplies, wake up calls, etc) which is a bit of a pain. Try and get rooms at back of hotel as quieter and avoid rooms on top floor with a 06/07 ending as the roof is sloped so feels a bit claustrophobic";
"Really nice hotel with European classic design, its make my stay was wonderful and mesmerizing. All facilities are good and really nice ambience, make me feels like in my own home. All the staffs are very kind and sincere. Special thanks to Ms. Liza from front desk, who delivered an excellent service to me, and also gave me a late check out at 2pm. Will be back soon for sure :)";
"its simple place with cozy ambiance, also the deluxe room really worth it, free netflix? yes please, clean and tidy althou small bathroom is more than enough to suffice your stay, its close to a range of streetfood you could order. definetly would do a simple staycation here again!";
"A perfect getaway in the middle of the city, near the MRT station and small food stalls and coffee shop. the room is cozy and comfortable, also very clean. I like the industrial themed bathroom wall. Definitely will book the room again.";
"I had a really pleasant stay at Flat06 Cipete. Both types of room are spacious and comfortable. Rooms are equipped with TV (Netflix are only available for the bigger room - Superior room if I‚Äôm not mistaken), refri (also for the bigger room - but if you stay at the smaller room you are still free to use the refri in the kitchen), good quality AC, cool bathroom (the heater was nicely functioned), desk and chair, soo many storages (on the tv desk, on the side of the bed), cupboard, and coffee maker. You can even plan on making a fancy dinner, because the kitchen is the best part! They offer a complete set of cooking utilities that you are free to use.   They might still need improvement on the bathroom because it was a bit smelly (just a bit), and also it was a bit noisy because";

Appreciate the helpfull team in housekeeping the whole time and any request is handle in good manner.   I will return to this hotel in my next trip and would reccomend M Hotel to anyone who look for clean and budget hotel in Blok M area.  Cheers DA";
"My second time staying here and the M is as nice and comfortable as before, with very clean rooms and friendly, attentive, and caring English-speaking staff.  Literally a stone's throw away from Blok M Square and adjacent to the Japanese district which has an East Asian grocer, a Starbucks, and myriad Japanese restaurants.  The other Blok M area malls are within each walking distance as is the MRT, and convenience stores are ubiquitous.  Convenient is that each level has a table and chairs to sit outside one's room, and smoking is no problem since this area is adjacent to an open-air atrium, with a hot/cold bottled water machine beside.  There are two lobby areas on the ground level which provide extra security as the inside lobby can only be reached by key card.";
"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 25 to 29 october 2019. Got a room on the 2nd floor (201). The guests are given the access card that also serves as a security card. I like that. The hotel is accessable to the Blok M Square and also a short walking distant to the Blok M bus terminal. Breakfast was great! I would surely return to this hotel for my next visit";
"The hotel service are excellent. I found my room always clean and tidy during my business trip to Jakarta. The staff are also always very helpful. Internet also super fast and I had no issue on Wi-fi connection. Good Job M Hotel!!!";

"Web stayed at budget hotel so, we get what we paid actually. I'm not trying to sound that it's a bad thing. I'd say Neo Tendean hotel exceeds as a budget hotel. For its price, we received excellent hospitality from its staff. Food was good. WiFi was available and considerably fast.  Would choose to stay at this hotel again. Thanks, guys. Keep up the good work!";
"We checked in late around 11 PM after catching a flight. When we entered our room it was not made up--the pillows and blanket are messy, the bathroom floor is wet. In the corridor, the ceiling had a noticable hole. The manager apologized and moved us to another room. It was after 12 AM, we are trying to sleep (the A.C was not cold at all) and the staff knocked to gave us fruit platter as an apology. We appreciate your gesture but you should have wait until the morning. And the plate is too big to be stored in the refrigerator. We gave up and checked out in the morning although we already booked (and paid) for another 2 nights.";
"I chose this hotel because it is located close to the Senopati area in Jakarta. It did not dis-appoint me. Firstly the staff are very friendly and the check in is very fast. Next the room was of good size and the bed was very comfortable.  It has a nice restaurant on the ground floor called Clays and a cafe called X coffee which serves coffee in ice cream cones. There is also a swimming pool but it is small. It is very easy to book a grab taxi from this place.";
"My husband and I used to have weekend getaway once a month. This time we choose Neo Hotel Tendean since the hotel located near our office in South Jakarta. When we arrived, we found the duvet and linen are dirty and smells bad as well. The towel also grey, and I have to asked the cleaning service to change the linen and duvet since there were many stain on it.  The bathroom also dissapointed since the design seems all wrong without any door for shower space. So when you take a bath, the floor will be wet and easily to slip on it. They have a small swimming pool, yet I was questioning about their design for it. They put tables around the pool so the guest can sit and enjoy. However, the water spilled everywhere near the table if someone goes into it because they seems don't have";

"The room was quite nice and have a view of the MRT which my son loved. No coffee or tea maker which makes it difficult for me to make milk for my toddler. However there is the water dispenser near the elevator.  The breakfast was okay, however the cleanliness was not. The utensils they used was for everything. They don't use separate thong.";
"I came late to stay with my family, Hotel itself brought us to minimalize interior and also enough variety of foods while taking our breakfast. My comment just for increasing your service delivery, it was taken a long time to deliver guest's request especially in the night up to 11pm  and train all staff to have diplomatic way how to handle guest's questions. Overall it was good enough. Thank you";
"I‚Äôve stayed in this hotel for more than 10 times, but everytime i go to Jakarta i always make this hotel as my choice.

"We missed our room  at the hotel next door, so we chose Amos Cozy A very bad hotel with bad service. Not that cheap at all.  We have chosen a junior suite, because we had 4 big suitcases, that will never fit in a standard room.

The toilet is not good either. And the toiletries is not good also (the toothbrush)  The good thing here is the swimming pool which is indoor n quiet clean, but not the fitness room, when i come, 8pm... its already dark n no one there!";
"I would comment satisfactory on the overall service. During check in, the ambience was felt when entering the hotel. I appread to be as cosy and classy as what was expected, the check-in process took a little longer, but was tolerable as I was upgraded from my reserved room to another room which was even more spacious.  I was so impressed with the location of the front desk. It is location in way that makes it look non mainstream. The hospitality rendered by most of the staffs should be given credits especially to a staff namely Asih. She was positioned at the Kokoo restaurant where we had our breakfast. She seemed very mobile and friendly. Her soft and polite character has gotten our attention to extend our gratitude of her excellent job. Such an excellent service skill that";
