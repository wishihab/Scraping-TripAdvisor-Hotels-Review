Palmerah,"Hotel Santika Slipi is one of my fave hotel to staycation. The hotel location is very strategic, because it's close to mall, such as Mal Taman Anggrek, Central Park, Grand Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, and Senayan City.  It is also suites for family with children, becase it has a large swimming pool. Children would love it.  The breakfast buffet also has various of menus. And inside the restaurant, there's a children play room, so you don't have to worry if your children a little bit grumpy.  The room is quite big for Deluxe and Superior Type, neat, clean, no carpet, and have a long sofa.  Next to the hotel, there's also padang Restaurant  Sederhana "" and Indomaret for your first help :)""",
Palmerah,"I had amazing experience with this hotel. I reserved for my Sister Anniversary and everything is amazing.  The staff was very helpful friendly. Especially for Mr. Yudha and FO team, thank you so much for your kind assistance, i really appreciated. Also the room is very clean and hygine.  Sure I'll be back! Thank you, and stay safe for you all.",
Palmerah,Definitely one of the top recommendation hotel in Jakarta.  The staff and marketing such as Mrs Vika are so helpful especially with the detail information re:new normal.   Santika Premiere Hotel has good buffet breakfast. And what i like the most is their swimming pool.,
Palmerah,"Good service. Nice room. Nice food,  Friendly staff like Isma, Sulis, Leo, Alex, Shaldy. From restaurant. Nothing to much for them to make you feel like at home. At concierge staff also always helpful with your  luggage. Special to say thank you to manager Rosa. She lead all staff in good way.",
Palmerah,Hotel is located a short distant from the main highway to Bogor which is ideal for golfers who wants to enjoy Jakarta nightlife and avoid the morning traffic jam going to Bogor golf courses. Room are clean and spacious. Morning breakfast spread is wonderful. You can choose between local dishes and some simple western breakfast. Highly recommended if you're looking for hotel which is  value for money.,
Palmerah,"this hotel is very strategic .. located on the side of the road and near the mall. I was very helped by mr.yordan, the service was very good. very patient and know what i need, I was given the best and clean room. the view of the city outside the window is great. I will definitely come here again. Thanks",
Palmerah,"Had a very good deal using Batur meeting room for about 3 weeks. Mr. Rayan (S&M) and Mr. Harry (FB Service) were really helpful and flexible in accommodating our needs. One minor thing is about the cleanliness of the meeting room area toilets, more frequent checking will do the purpose. The hotel itself is located in a very strategic location, really good for business purpose or family staycation on weekend.",
Palmerah,"Everything was well. Friendly staff, most specially to front desk Yordan who helps me to check in late at night. Hotel is clean as well as room and lobby. Hotel is very accessible by public transportation.",
Palmerah,"All I can say is you guys all done a good job. Check in process was fast handled by the welcome staff, Ms.Vita. The room is cozy and cleanliness well maintained. We also enjoyed our breakfast as it have a lot of choices and the restaurant staffs are very helpful.",
Palmerah,"I choose Ibis for my stay while doing some works. Comfortable room, fast internet connection, and location near the place i need to go. The journey for my bussiness feels success this time. Thank you, Ibis.",
Palmerah,"It is an average value for money hotel. Comfortable, clean bathrooms but found a cockroach in my room which they readily removed. Buffet breakfast has good spread. The hotel charges taxi for parking if it comes upto the lobby to pick you. That's unfair. On the main road, so we'll connected.",
Palmerah,"I stay at studio room, furniture little bit too old. Room spacious, really love it.The pool was average. Near the airport and easy to find streetfood. But they have a good breakfast. The staf soo welcoming, especially in the pool.",
Palmerah,"i stayed at this hotel for 11 nights days i came for business. I encountered a hotel much more than I expected. so far I have stayed in hundreds of hotels due to my job and everything like this did not stay in a wonderful hotel. the rooms are clean, big enough, the room price is reasonable, the breakfast in the morning and especially the buffet dinner is a legend. the location is very good, it is so bad that you can get right off the highway from Jakarta traffic. the pool is very big and pleasant.In short everything that comes to mind is really good.duty manager eddy, thanks to you. I will come again next month and I will stay at this hotel again. I would recommend it to everyone",
Palmerah,They’ve city view from almost all the room. They’ve karaoke too. Break is also good. Room is spacious. Worth the price. Hospitality is also good. Staff is friendly. The location is also good. Value for money!,
Palmerah,"It has been 15years i stay at this hotel for business trip First one is the location in central of Jakarta and easy to go everywhere because near highway access, busway station at in front of the hotel  And their staff very friendly and helpful, and guests satisfaction, especially ms. Gita at reception, mr. Yohanes at Concierge, mr. Eddie at Coleman restaurant and the orhers  If we need something like iron for cloth, incoming / outgoing facsimile facility, etc, they can help us They always give a box of chocolate when I check in  Worth it to stay at this hotel",
Palmerah,"We had a trip to Jkt, for company business. We reserved about 15 rooms, twin share. hotel location is little bit away from the center of the city. The building is remain stay and old, some part need reparation or renovation. But so far, hotel is clean and tidy. Hotel Staff also friendly and quick response. Breakfast meal is also nice for budget hotel like Mega Anggrek. Pool is located on 3rd floor. They have a wide parking area. Very limited rooms equipped with bathtub. You better ask first to Front Office if you required bathtub.",
Palmerah,"This hotel has a good service, clean room and delicious food. They good at handling complaint for they guests. Near to shopping mall department store, and not too far from the airtport. I highly recommend this hotel. Thank u Mega Anggrek Hotel:)",
Palmerah,"What a great story to be here guys. Delicious food,  strategic place, easy to find the hotel, friendly price, and friendly staff. Totally amazing. Promise to be here next time guys. Don't you want to make a great experience in your end of the year? Be here guys,trust me.  😘😘😘",
Palmerah,"Please re consider if you want to stay here. The hotel is really old, the room is outdated and smelly. The bathroom is not really clean. The service is really bad, I asked for extra pillow and within 1 hour still waiting. The price is also not cheap considering there are many cheaper hotels with better service and quality. Really regret the decision to stay in this hotel. You have been warned.",
Palmerah,"Hi all, Im back again to review a hotel in west jakarta, near taman anggrek mall, yap mega anggrek hotel""  Here is the review First time i came at 7.30pm there is one staff (security) but he didnt even greet us, only looking on his phone and smoking (outsite hotel), in front of lobby there is another security i think he will opened the door (like other 4 stars hotel) but he didnt even move to open or greet us, he just standing like a statue (arrghh i think i got wrong hotel to stay)  And then we come to receptionist, there is plus point for this hotel, he really nice service, inform us any facility what we get.  Next we walk to tower 2 that our room on 4th floor, after get out from lift on 4th floor, its really spooky (because there is no one there either visitor nor the""",
Palmerah,"A few years ago, this was my favorite hotel whenever I went to Jakarta.  The place was very clean and the restaurant was quite good. Everybody was polite and helpful. And in my opinion the price was extremely reasonable.",
Palmerah,I always stay here with my family when in Jakarta. The breakfast buffet is good Sri and Rama were super helpful serving us! The doormen and bellmen are superb too! We had a lot of luggage and they were all smiles helping us!! The pool and gym are a bonus as well! I like the location of the Ibis as its on a quiet street centrally located in the city. Thankyou we will be back.,
Palmerah,Steady and visible improves Great and good  One minor issue I appreciate that we are indonesia and many guests are local   But..NO WINE AT ALL Only beer???  Guys..really...i am not suggesting we stock full range of vintage chateaux lol But NONE?? umm,
Palmerah,"Though the room may need some renovations, it is properly maintained.  Jakarta seems to have heavy traffic jams.  But this hotel is close to TransJakarta Busway station.  So, without heavy luggage, you can cover most of the tourist attractions in Jakarta easily by using Koridor lines.",
Palmerah,"I would not reconmmend this hotel, unless you have no other options. They rooms are very old and it shows, from the shower space to the fixtures and fittings. It is ideally located in the central part of Jarkarta, and the staff are lovely, but i would prefer to stay elsewhere.",
Palmerah,"I've been visiting this hotel for the third time last week, and it was okay. The room was clean and cozy, also value for money. It is located on a small street near S. Parman street, a lot of street food and besides to Alfamrt. Probably will repurchased.",
Palmerah,Booked this hotel solely because it is near to the location that I needed to visit. The room that I stayed looked old to me. The bathroom door was 'decaying' (wood door) and needed to change a new one and the terrifying thing was spotting an unusually big red ant in the room. Overall just a basic room with very basic service.,
Palmerah,"Didnt expect that bamboo inn is a nice and surprisingly cozy for an inn"" small but cozy room, standard bathroom, got my cable tv.  Transit hotel very near dharmais. Breakfast included..very basic breakfast. Good place to lay back for a while.""",
Palmerah,"This is a very nice hotel facilities a cheap hotel can give in Jakarta. It is located around Slipi area, which is near the toll road to the airport. But the location was a little bit hard to find. Not on the main street, but on the small street beside the Harapan Kita Hospital.",
Palmerah,I stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting family. Yes rooms could do with a refurbishment but for only 2 nights for somewhere to shower and sleep this was ideal. Staff were friendly and were always asking if I was ok as I was staying on my own. Would stay here again,
Palmerah,"clean strategic place  comfortable and budget is very nice. I am very please to stay longer there but we just stay 4 days. The location is very closest with cetntre market in jakarta, tanah abang. We fully recommend if you are waiting for your family who dirawat di rs pelni salah satu hotel yang direkomendasikan ini.",
Palmerah,"Hotel Alma is the best choice if you just want a room to stay or take a rest which location is near Tanah Abang. It's also cheap. The room facilities are air conditioner, television, and wifi connection.  Unfortunately, just never expect too much for the breakfast menu. Twice I stayed there and I was always disappointed because of food. I didnt know either some guests took the food a lot or hotel's food stocks for breakfast werent enough. It made me spend extra money to order omellete to enjoy my breakfast. However, the staffs were helpful.",
Palmerah,"nice hotel, stay for 2 nite at standard room 315,000 rp + breakfast for 2 (attached bathroom + 2 single bed + air conditioner). have a lcd tv with more than 10 channel including HBO, ESPN. 10mins walk to Tanah Abang. lil bit noisy bcoz in front of the main road. overall it just nice if you come to shopping at Tanah Abang.",
Palmerah,"Did not planned to stay here. We checked out from our previous hotel as it was far from Jakarta. This place was recommended by our taxi driver as being cheap, clean and close to the famous local market called Tanah Abang. Room was small, dusty with a window which was pretty much useless as it was blocked by the air-conditioning unit. Bathroom was leaky all over. Worst of all me, my wife and one of kids woke up with bites from bed bugs.  The breakfast was really dismal. It was included in the rate and it was sort of first come first served. They did not replenish the dishes. It was a 10 minutes walk to Tanah Abang market but that 10 minutes walk was very nerve-wrecking walking along the busy and crowded street with not so comforting characters by the roadside.  I will definitely",
Palmerah,"I thank you so much for taking care of us for 6 days, trying to filling up our requests which is plenty ,being informative ! And the very sweet greetings when we come till we leave! Especially to Mrs NANA ( front desk lady) great job! 👍",
Palmerah,I have spent 3d2n at this hotel and really enjoyed my stay there. I stayed at the corner unit which was a bit bigger than other units. Room was quite comfortable with a double bed and a big sofa. The bathroom was clean. The view from the room has a stunning view to the city skyline. This hotel is not new but the maintenance was good. It is a local Indonesian style hotel but some modern decorating. The location is just nice which is not far from major tourist attractions. Would highly recommend it.,
Palmerah,"I had a great time here, nice place, great services, friendly staff, it's all worth every penny I spent. Above my expectations. Gonna stay here for my next trip. Definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.",
Palmerah,I stayed at this hotel on Feb with my friends i'm happy stayed in here because all staff very welcome specially mr Alam he is helpfull and smile is nice. And breakfast very nice any kind of food in buffet. I will Come back to this hotel sure.. Thank you mercure and pak alam,
Palmerah,"I have spent 1 week at the Mercure Jakarta for a Business Trip. It was perfect and above all very professional guest relation officers throughout my stay. The room was clean, comfortable with a nice view on the sea. The breakfast was very abundant and healthy.  thanks a lot, especially NINIK, SANDRA and VILEN",
Palmerah,Our experience staying here was good. We requested for an early check-in by 13.30 and the hotel had no problems adhering to our wishes.. the check-in and check-out process was Express (just like the name)... and this was good!   The room was clean and cosy.. Wi-Fi was fast.. Unfortunately though because of Covid-19 health protocols our breakfast came in food boxes and there was the option for tea/coffee also  Overall our experience was good...,
Palmerah,"THis is the best Holiday Inn Express I had stayed in all the Holiday Inn Express in my past travels in Europe,  USA and also region in Asia Pacific.   For Business traveller and small business operator,  this is truly our home for doing business in Jakarta.",
Palmerah,"Check inn service: Good! Spacious and Tidy rooms and extra needed toilet supplies included. Breakfast is good. I would like to personally thank the Front office department. The Three ladies that assistance me at my stayovers are reliable, loyal & hospitality, casual talented employees  Puput , Arnita & Fitria. for the rememberly stay over at the holiday inn Express Jakarta matraman. Keep it up. Thank u madame Puput!",
Palmerah,This was my first time staying at this hotel. Quick check-in process without any hassle. The room was also quite spacious for a Holiday Inn Express hotel and it was clean also. The WiFi connection was OK but the thing that could be improved is the breakfast options and quality.,
Palmerah,"I think, Hi express Jakarta Matraman is the best hotel in Matraman area. The room very new and clean and fresh, breakfast nice with many variety and good wifi connection. Thank you for Ms Dyiah fo for great us with warm welcome ❤️",
Palmerah,"I stay 4 night for business trip in Jakarta. Room are specious with big bed. Room cleanliness very good and room view to the city. Staff very friendly and helpful, retaurant staff always greeting you even they busy. It's a good sign that staff respect all the guest. Good location, not too far from central business and easy to get taxi. Very recomended for you who will go to Jakarta.   Congratulation for the management.  Regards, Gregorius",
Palmerah,"Nice hotel at the central of Jakarta. Good for solo travel. Near to Public transport. Theres a suki restaurant, great sauce. Lots of street food vendors in the evening. Room pretty clean, spacious too for superior stayed at #303. Complete amenities. Just a small and awkard placement of sqimming pool.",
Palmerah,"The room very clean and comfy, and staff were friendly too. It’s very nice and strategic place to stay with affordable price. Food taste was great, my favorite was suki. We had a great time there. Thankyou",
Palmerah,"It's a great strategic hotel in Jakarta. Located in town and also has various accesses to get there. The hotel is nice and comfy. Pleasure rest guaranteed. Facilities are good too, but the swimming pool not so big and I cancel my plan to swim since it is located in very front of reception desk with a huge window. So, if you're not embarassed bee seen by reception while swimming, it's okay, but not for me. So I choose to use fitness room instead.  The hotel really clean and staff were friendly too. They are really helpful. I booked twin room since that is the only optio  available on agoda, but when I asked to change, they change it into queen bed room without any charge. Then they are strictly forbid smoking but they help me to get a room with window can be opened. They really",
Palmerah,"Great service, strategic location, their staff so friendly. The room was good made me not want to wake up. The food is very good especially the dim sum and suki.  I definitely come back and stay again at this hotel",
Palmerah,"I stay in hotel kalisma for three days, standard price is not too expensive, there is a dish for breakfast, looking for food outside not too far away, looking for something easy, I like the food that is in front of the hotel...",
Palmerah,"It's not my first time have a night in here, I've been several times coming to kalisma hotel. This is the best hotel for work because of its flexibility. But if you plan to stay for vacation, or enjoying the facility of a hotel, there's several hotel that outcome kalisma, at the same price range. My review : 1. Breakfast, less variety of food,  standard taste, un-enjoyable, nothing special. 2. Service, not friendly enough 3. The room is neat and wide, flat lcd tv with variety channel, but the air conditioner and bathroom, in several rooms are disapointed. 4. Wifi just accessible in lobby, with that price we should be get wifi access in our room 5. We could smoke in the room, it's the best part from kalisma that I love most. 6. They have Many rooms  So I come in conclusion, that",
Palmerah,Close by and walking distance to Tanah Abang transport taxi or bas very easy to get. The hotel rate is very reasonable and is affordable.The staff are very friendly and helpful and able to communicate in english.,
Palmerah,"Stayed for a week. Good and central location. Lively location with plenty of street food and a slightly more upmarket Padang food restaurant about 100m away. Supermarket is a short walk away.  I would recommend a room on the eastern (railway) side of hotel. The western side rooms are a bit dark with no natural light.  The place is not difficult to find as long as you know where to find it. There's a small sign at the front fence"" of the building. The entrance is along the side of the building (opposite side of the driveway) about 20m in.  Clean and comfortable enough.""",
Palmerah,"I stayed here for one night because of its low price and strategic location. For the price, I was happy with the clean and simple room, nice air conditioner and very comfortable bed.   There are a few places to eat close by but, as in many places in Jakarta, it’s difficult to walk on the ‘pavement.’ There is an indomaret close by and a really lovely little bakery across the road.   The only issue was actually finding the place. There is a zen rooms board outside, but no actual entrance. I had to ask around with people on the street and nobody knew where it was located. I ended up walking into a basement car park, and asked the parking attendant. He directed me to a lift that led to the hotel.  The receptionist didn’t speak any English, but it was not a problem.   I would",
Palmerah,"For budget hotel, I kinda like this hotel from ZEN Rooms. The staffs are nice and very helpful. They help a lot! Super affordable price (which is important for me), yet found got so much good things inside, from clean bed to fast Wi-Fi.",
Palmerah,"The location is strategic walking distance to Palmerah market and station. The room is spaceous and clean. All is provided, from toiletries to mineral water. The wifi is awesome too. TV is suppoprted by various channels. So recommended.",
Palmerah,"Very nicely located hotel at super affordable price. What i liked was the quality of the bed,  strength of AC and of course fast internet. One drawback was early cleaning so staff woke me up but this is quite small thing",
Palmerah,"I read some negative reviews and it was make me worried until I’m the one that experienced it. I love the lady in the receptionist desk, she was so helpful and friendly. They asked me to leave the deposit for RP.100.000 and told me to keep the receipt and can get the money back once check out. The room is big and clean, good air conditioner and comfy bed. My room was in 3th floor with window city view. The hotel next to Amaris Hotel and just need to walk for like 3 minutes to reach RS Harapan Kita Busway Stops. Close to Taman Anggrek and Central Park Mall. I would love to come back again in the near future.",
Palmerah,"this place is litle bit dirty and to old for a hotel in the capital city of indonesia, I just not recommanded you to stay there, its not like you look in the picture. Once I show somrthing in my bed, look like an insect over my toilet. O my God it was horrible moment for me thats all from me, traveller  hanks, regard",
Palmerah,not impressive at all despite a decent location..  rooms are worn out and even the bathroom.. no gym facility.. lift seems like it's going to fall off.. room very noisy especially if you are facing the hospital.. breakfast was good though and staff friendly..,
Palmerah,A quite good room and facilities that are worth it with the price. The place is very strategic around West Jakarta. The place is clean and quite spacious. The concierge is helpful and also this hotel is completed with free parking facility,
Palmerah,The location strategic near with Mal Taman Anggrek and Central Park. The room is large but the furniture in was old and need redecoration. The swimming pool need repairment. The food is delicious and variatif.,
Palmerah,"Toilets are horribly stained.  AC is not cold.  Water heater is virtually non-existing. Toiletries limited to two slices of mini soap. Sheets are off white.  Bed sags and is springy.  No Cable TV. No WIFI.   In the terrible condition the Hotel is, it is grossly overpriced. I was charged 129 Ringgit Malaysia for a Superior Room using Agoda booking (which also did not have accurate and current facilities of the Hotel).  The Hotel should seriously lower its prices more OR make the hard choice of closing down and renovate its premises.  As is - AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS.",
Palmerah,"This is the worst hotel i ever stayed. Jakarta such a big city and the main central of Indonesia. This hotel located in area that full with tourist that want to shop at Tenabang shopping mall. Poor thing, service is really bad, air-condition around hotel not working, wifi hard to connect at lobby, morning breakfast buffet kind of sad 4 choices including drinks??this is the worst hotel of my travel experience so far. Sadly, the hotel is a great potential. I don't even think the owner really understand about hotel management or hospitality even common sense.",
Palmerah,"The hotel are just 400 meters to Tanah Abang business centre,  for those who planned to do shopping this is a good place to stay, but during peak hours when the hotel are full the top floor may experience water disruption cause the pressure are too low.The neighbouring area are not a good sight to look for. It is a rainy season we can see the neighbours drain ing flood water from their premises. Transport a",
Kebayoran Baru,"Gran Mahakam was the hotel I was going prior to the pandemic when I wanted to enjoy a great breakfast. This time, the breakfast was awful.  In my opinion, we value a service not when everything is going well but when the hotel still does its best to maintain the standard when the situation is hard. In Gran Mahakam failed in this. Instead of trying to do its best to remain a reference, they tried to save money where they shouldn't.  A very bad point for me. Moreover when we knot that the room in Gran Mahakam, compared to the value, are not the best in the city. No point to pay 1 million IDR for this night. Sorry for this bad review because the worker are still very kind.",
Kebayoran Baru,"I stayed at this hotel because of my cousin's wedding. It has a quiet big room, very suitable for families. The room has elegant room interior, has thick and cozy carpet, with big furniture.  My children very comfortable stayed in here.",
Kebayoran Baru,"I stayed with my husband for a short escape. Best hotels for families and couples, since it's comfortable enough and very homey. Love the interior, restaurant, and pool. Nice food and services. We reserved the suite room and it was all satisfied.",
Kebayoran Baru,"First time being here was back then during my Grandma's birthday in 2007. Back then the meal was spectacular. They have the most amazing Indonesian dish in my opinion. Over the time I came back again in 2010, 2018 for friend's wedding and just now, March 15 2020. We had special request of Japanese menu, crab handroll wrapped in edamame sheet, amazing! Their Nasi Combrang is also worth to try and of course their tasty dimsum. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming, from valet to restaurant staffs, all of them are very welcoming. If you're looking for good brunch or dinner, Gran Mahakam is the right place in South Jakarta.",
Kebayoran Baru,"Gran Mahakam has been kind of second home for my family and we’re going to this place regularly for special occasions: NYE, birthday dinner, or any other occasions. The staff(s) are very welcoming and helpful. We were once here for staycation too and it was lovely experience :) def recommended hotel!",
Kebayoran Baru,"Stayed there for 1 night in room 217, the room view was the street and transjakarta stop. The sound from the street, exhaust pipe of motorcycles and cars can be heard from our room, which annoying part.  The staffs were very friendly and helpful.  Requested the upper floor, unfortunately not available.  The room was nice, bed was comfortable, pillows as well, all the light use warm white style. The bathroom was nice but still need more repairs on the ceramic near shower.  Parking was a bit difficult for indoor but there are a lot of spaces for outdoor.",
Kebayoran Baru,"I mean like.. who doesn’t like Veranda? Good facilities. Near from nice places to hangout. Great breakfast. Nice pool ❤️. Pretty lobby. Also, helpful staffs! I love Wyls restaurant and The Japanese restaurant next to it. It’s called ‘Wabaru’. Can’t wait to be back!",
Kebayoran Baru,"Nice hotel, friendly staffs. A great place to stay for business and private stay too.  Breakfast quite a handful choices to select from.  And it is a great place to chill especially after a hard day at work",
Kebayoran Baru,I always stay at this hotel every week or at least once a month. There was a time that i stayed 2 nights or 2 times check in at this hotel. The staff remember me already and they are very kind. The room is very homy. And now i feel like miss this hotel already hahaha,
Kebayoran Baru,This is my 3rd time I stay in the hotel. I tried many other hotels before & I must say I like this hotel. Good rate for business traveler who just want to have a good rest at night.   The choices of breakfast is quite a lot compare to others &  quality of the food 👍. They have a Japanese restaurant which is also very nice.   I don’t have the chance to try/use the other facilities but the room is almost perfect. Sound proof. Nice bed. AC works great. I like the long & wide table that I can put many stuff there but only 1 power outlet near the table. Hot & cold shower with fine spray. This is important.  Surely I will go back to this hotel.,
Kebayoran Baru,"The 101 Hotel is a simple hotel located in Dharmawangsa area-south Jakarta. 101 Hotel is offering your with a reasonable price and clean.

Kebayoran Baru,"What I'd really like about this hotel is late check-out at 3pm.  The room quite spacious and there is comfy sofas on deluxe room.  The staffs also very helpful and nice.  The breakfast is simple, but tastes good.  The minus is this premises located near traditional market, sometimes the bad smells came into lobby.",
Kebayoran Baru,Thank you kyriad for the hospitality shown during our visit. We surprise the hotel improved a lot since our last stay. Now during covid 19.

Kebayoran Baru,"Just visited Ambhara hotel for short getaway last night. Arrive at 08:00 p.m. my plan was to grab a quick dinner and then go to sleep, but the interior design of the hotel made me wandering around. And about the room, I don't know what fragrance they use but it's sooo relaxing and I really really love it!. 😇  I told you about the design right? Check out the wardrobe pic I took, it's so majestic! Made me think of it as one of that Narnian door. 😆  At 07:30 a.m. I'm about to leave the hotel and I received a heartwarming check out service by Miss Widya. I mean all the staffs are super friendly, they'll greet you in a nice gesture and all. But Miss Widya is different, you can see her smile and sincerity even though she's wearing a face mask! Someone's eyes really can tell a lot I",

Kebayoran Baru,"Ambhara Hotel Jakarta is on top of my mind when it comes to an event. On this special occasion of my past birthday, I want to rejoice with my friends in a cozy place along with the broad menu they offer that we're craving for.   I also want to acknowledge the following people who've helped us out to have this experience, Bu Dina (Director of Sales & Marketing) and the staffs, Lovy, Dian and 2 kitchen trainees for their attentive services.  If you guys read this, please go make your reservation and enjoy this money-worthy yummy 😋.",

Kebayoran Baru,"I stayed there for 1 nights in 21st Oct 2020. This hotel is strategic, near from everywhere, especially when you have meeting in South area of Jakarta. Lobby looks fine and clean. The staff are also friendly. I haven't seen even a single seat table chair at the lobby, so you really don’t want to wait for anyone here upon check in or check out. I was given a room #3344. The room are quite large and clean. Even though I had a problem with the room at the first time, luckily Rina the receptionist and the engineering staff that I forgot the name was very helpful and indulgent, she was fast and sincere, when I needed so many things.",
Kebayoran Baru,"So far good, if your trip is to enjoy the hotel and can have access to malls, cafes and good. restaurants nearby, a perfect choice to stay.  However, in terms of service could do better. The guest service supposed to be an excellent service, however need to improve in their human resource. - how to treat customers better.",
Kebayoran Baru,"We love the pillow and the bed, bathrobe. Very comfy. I wonder where to buy it. I really want to have one :). The staff and the service was excellent. I love my short anniversary staycation. I will come back for sure!!!!",
Kebayoran Baru,"Amazing location and city view. Located at Sudirman Central business fistrict, prime location in Jakarta. Simple, Modern, & minimalist design with contemporer art instalation. The service was great. There are 3 restaurant (vong kitchen, le burger and hakkasan at the rooftop). Near pacific place shopping mall and idx tower. They have amazing pool view with jacuzzi. I really love alilla's pajama towel, that's really cool.",
Kebayoran Baru,"Despite they only have 3 types of rooms, almost all rooms on 1 floor have different sizes. If you book xl studio and allocated room ending with #10, it's one of the smalllest room they have and has no work area. This is very strange because even the studio room has work area. The only reason they sell it as a xl studio instead of studio king is because the bathroom has a bath tub. Even if this room is sold as a studio, it didn't even fulfil the standard because all the rooms are advertised equipped with work area.  Appreciate the team allocated me to another room which is one of the biggest room for xl studio. The guest experience manager also came up with a souvenir and card when I check out. However, first impression does matter and it wasn't a good one. It somehow ruins our",
Kebayoran Baru,Best hotel in the city with a nice staff & good services. Having a birthday such a wonderful time in there . Also it’s very easy to access to mall Pasific place . Having dinner & breakfast just by walk ..,
Kebayoran Baru,"Spent a few days here, its a nice hotel in terms of look and feel. A heritage look with many unique and traditional touches which would be interesting for people from other countries.  The room was decently sized for 2 persons, a very spacious shower area which was so big you could swing a cat, even a dog in it. On the other hand the toilet was small and if you were sitting down, you would need to swing aside to close the door. Minor details.  Nice capsule style coffee machine, standard bottles of water and a very nice toiletries set designed by an Australian company called Apothecary. Great scents.   The room air-conditioning was not functioning well tho, even after being re-booted, it worked well for a few hours and then it was back to being warm and not cool. Not sure if its",
Kebayoran Baru,"stayed here to celebrate our anniversary 2 weeks ago, a week before we checked in, we request to have a decoration in the room. the decoration is just a standard one, and they also sent us a piece of cake as a complimentary. We dont have chance to breakfast in SOFIA since it was closed for hotel guest, too bad. my highlight is the breakfast option. since they dont serve buffet breakfast, so they offer us 1 meal only ( ala carte ) menu. a bit disappointed because we pay for a good rate to stay there. i have nasi goreng, and they waitress said if we want to have another menu, they'll charge us. too bad.",
Kebayoran Baru,"So pretty! Not the largest or most practical hotel (there is barely enough room to put toiletries or space in room to hang clothes), but I would stay again just because it's so nice to come back to an aesthetically pleasing room after a long day. Staff was also very pleasant.  The breakfast is pretty lousy, it's a la carte and not tasty at all. Couldn't finish my breakfast.  In spite of its shortcomings I would still stay again. Not recommended if you are a very practical person though.",
Kebayoran Baru,"Great alternative to usual boring business hotels. More homely, warm and nice colonial historical feel. Rooms ok if small and restaurant downstairs (Sofia) is good for both breakfast and dinner. Staff nice and friendly if at times a bit forgetful. Slightly let down by noisy aircon and at times things get forgotten (replenishing room supplies, wake up calls, etc) which is a bit of a pain. Try and get rooms at back of hotel as quieter and avoid rooms on top floor with a 06/07 ending as the roof is sloped so feels a bit claustrophobic",
Kebayoran Baru,"Really nice hotel with European classic design, its make my stay was wonderful and mesmerizing. All facilities are good and really nice ambience, make me feels like in my own home. All the staffs are very kind and sincere. Special thanks to Ms. Liza from front desk, who delivered an excellent service to me, and also gave me a late check out at 2pm. Will be back soon for sure :)",
Kebayoran Baru,"its simple place with cozy ambiance, also the deluxe room really worth it, free netflix? yes please, clean and tidy althou small bathroom is more than enough to suffice your stay, its close to a range of streetfood you could order. definetly would do a simple staycation here again!",
Kebayoran Baru,"A perfect getaway in the middle of the city, near the MRT station and small food stalls and coffee shop. the room is cozy and comfortable, also very clean. I like the industrial themed bathroom wall. Definitely will book the room again.",
Kebayoran Baru,"I had a really pleasant stay at Flat06 Cipete. Both types of room are spacious and comfortable. Rooms are equipped with TV (Netflix are only available for the bigger room - Superior room if I’m not mistaken), refri (also for the bigger room - but if you stay at the smaller room you are still free to use the refri in the kitchen), good quality AC, cool bathroom (the heater was nicely functioned), desk and chair, soo many storages (on the tv desk, on the side of the bed), cupboard, and coffee maker. You can even plan on making a fancy dinner, because the kitchen is the best part! They offer a complete set of cooking utilities that you are free to use.   They might still need improvement on the bathroom because it was a bit smelly (just a bit), and also it was a bit noisy because",
Kebayoran Baru,"The location is strategic. Nearby MRT station, grocery store, atm. The room design is nice, simple yet unique. The room is clean enough. We can get free refill water in the kitchen. Free laundry 4 pieces every day",

Kebayoran Baru,I stayed last month in this hotel for business trip. I found my room extraordinary clean and nice bed.  Appreciate the helpfull team in housekeeping the whole time and any request is handle in good manner.   I will return to this hotel in my next trip and would reccomend M Hotel to anyone who look for clean and budget hotel in Blok M area.  Cheers DA,
Kebayoran Baru,"My second time staying here and the M is as nice and comfortable as before, with very clean rooms and friendly, attentive, and caring English-speaking staff.  Literally a stone's throw away from Blok M Square and adjacent to the Japanese district which has an East Asian grocer, a Starbucks, and myriad Japanese restaurants.  The other Blok M area malls are within each walking distance as is the MRT, and convenience stores are ubiquitous.  Convenient is that each level has a table and chairs to sit outside one's room, and smoking is no problem since this area is adjacent to an open-air atrium, with a hot/cold bottled water machine beside.  There are two lobby areas on the ground level which provide extra security as the inside lobby can only be reached by key card.",
Kebayoran Baru,I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 25 to 29 october 2019. Got a room on the 2nd floor (201). The guests are given the access card that also serves as a security card. I like that. The hotel is accessable to the Blok M Square and also a short walking distant to the Blok M bus terminal. Breakfast was great! I would surely return to this hotel for my next visit,
Kebayoran Baru,The hotel service are excellent. I found my room always clean and tidy during my business trip to Jakarta. The staff are also always very helpful. Internet also super fast and I had no issue on Wi-fi connection. Good Job M Hotel!!!,
Kebayoran Baru,There are plenty of places to eat and Location is so good.shop and convenient. The staff is also nice. It is the best if there is a refrigerator in the room.room price < good value .I recomend M hotel to you.,
Kebayoran Baru,"I stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is located near the Blok M Plaza, Blok M Square, and Blok M MRT Station. The location is very helpful to help me catch the public transportation.  . The staff were really responsive and friendly. Fast response service. But the room seemed not really nice for me. The cleanliness of the hotel should be improved.",

Kebayoran Baru,"Web stayed at budget hotel so, we get what we paid actually. I'm not trying to sound that it's a bad thing. I'd say Neo Tendean hotel exceeds as a budget hotel. For its price, we received excellent hospitality from its staff. Food was good. WiFi was available and considerably fast.  Would choose to stay at this hotel again. Thanks, guys. Keep up the good work!",
Kebayoran Baru,"We checked in late around 11 PM after catching a flight. When we entered our room it was not made up--the pillows and blanket are messy, the bathroom floor is wet. In the corridor, the ceiling had a noticable hole. The manager apologized and moved us to another room. It was after 12 AM, we are trying to sleep (the A.C was not cold at all) and the staff knocked to gave us fruit platter as an apology. We appreciate your gesture but you should have wait until the morning. And the plate is too big to be stored in the refrigerator. We gave up and checked out in the morning although we already booked (and paid) for another 2 nights.",
Kebayoran Baru,I chose this hotel because it is located close to the Senopati area in Jakarta. It did not dis-appoint me. Firstly the staff are very friendly and the check in is very fast. Next the room was of good size and the bed was very comfortable.  It has a nice restaurant on the ground floor called Clays and a cafe called X coffee which serves coffee in ice cream cones. There is also a swimming pool but it is small. It is very easy to book a grab taxi from this place.,
Kebayoran Baru,"My husband and I used to have weekend getaway once a month. This time we choose Neo Hotel Tendean since the hotel located near our office in South Jakarta. When we arrived, we found the duvet and linen are dirty and smells bad as well. The towel also grey, and I have to asked the cleaning service to change the linen and duvet since there were many stain on it.  The bathroom also dissapointed since the design seems all wrong without any door for shower space. So when you take a bath, the floor will be wet and easily to slip on it. They have a small swimming pool, yet I was questioning about their design for it. They put tables around the pool so the guest can sit and enjoy. However, the water spilled everywhere near the table if someone goes into it because they seems don't have",
Kebayoran Baru,"It is avarage hotel, better to stay there for work stay, not for holiday. Rooms are clean, breakfast enough. Location not so close to shopping centers, i mean not possible to arrive there by walk. You have to use taxi, and it is big problem in Jakarta traffic",
Kebayoran Baru,"stay for a week in the hotels due to wife moving for work. room was cigarette smell for the first time, no minibar available and must pay extra charge for minibar. room maintenance and cleanliness was poor. shower grout was mildew.  new normal protocol is Ok, front office staff was not friendly. security, housekeeping staff, Room service was friendly and warm welcome.",
Kebayoran Baru,"The room was quite nice and have a view of the MRT which my son loved. No coffee or tea maker which makes it difficult for me to make milk for my toddler. However there is the water dispenser near the elevator.  The breakfast was okay, however the cleanliness was not. The utensils they used was for everything. They don't use separate thong.",
Kebayoran Baru,"I came late to stay with my family, Hotel itself brought us to minimalize interior and also enough variety of foods while taking our breakfast. My comment just for increasing your service delivery, it was taken a long time to deliver guest's request especially in the night up to 11pm  and train all staff to have diplomatic way how to handle guest's questions. Overall it was good enough. Thank you",
Kebayoran Baru,"I’ve stayed in this hotel for more than 10 times, but everytime i go to Jakarta i always make this hotel as my choice. Its room service, its comfortable and clean rooms, its warmful greetings every time i arrived at the main door makes me want to come and come again.   Overall, it’s a great hotel.",
Kebayoran Baru,"employees who are not only friendly but very helpful in everything. besides this hotel room is very neat and clean, for hotels with cheap prices can get a good breakfast. this hotel is an affordable hotel that can get good facilities. the hotel also has many promotions with various discounts offered by this hotel❤❤",
Kebayoran Baru,"We missed our room  at the hotel next door, so we chose Amos Cozy A very bad hotel with bad service. Not that cheap at all.  We have chosen a junior suite, because we had 4 big suitcases, that will never fit in a standard room.  Bathroom, we got worn shower gel (1/2 bottle) Dirty toilet was not fixed and dirty, dirty full of spots on the plug. Dirty and filthy towels and bed sheets Will never and ever back again",
Kebayoran Baru,I have three days packages meeting. for first day actually there many problem about projector and banquet always standby to help start at 7am.  For the rest of the day everything the event is great. the food is very delicious and can handle at injury time and for the services is execellence.,
Kebayoran Baru,Left waiting for over an hour while the front desk tried to locate housekeeping staff to find a room that was cleaned - not airconditioned and after an hour I asked for a water  which was brought just before I finally went to the room - rarely lose my cool but close that day,
Kebayoran Baru,"This is 4 stars hotel, the price also cheap like 330k idr, but the front office is very bad in servicing me... they dont smile, they dont regret me, and also when they answer my question with bad gesture  When i come to the room, the water is not clean, and the heater sometime it works, sometimes it doesnt. The toilet is not good either. And the toiletries is not good also (the toothbrush)  The good thing here is the swimming pool which is indoor n quiet clean, but not the fitness room, when i come, 8pm... its already dark n no one there!",
Kebayoran Baru,"I would comment satisfactory on the overall service. During check in, the ambience was felt when entering the hotel. I appread to be as cosy and classy as what was expected, the check-in process took a little longer, but was tolerable as I was upgraded from my reserved room to another room which was even more spacious.  I was so impressed with the location of the front desk. It is location in way that makes it look non mainstream. The hospitality rendered by most of the staffs should be given credits especially to a staff namely Asih. She was positioned at the Kokoo restaurant where we had our breakfast. She seemed very mobile and friendly. Her soft and polite character has gotten our attention to extend our gratitude of her excellent job. Such an excellent service skill that",
Setiabudi,"Locating the best part of South Jakarta city, connecting to brand-shopping Mall, Lotte.  Due to Pandemic, hotel management reduces service and facilities including Manpower.  Please expect service level equal to Mercure, or Holiday Inn.  Please keep yourself more than to wait their response such as Breakfast time.  As told by the staff, you need to wait and understand due to they have only 2 servers for breakfast in the weekday time.  If you are expecting meet-to-level professionally hospitality standard, this is not hotel in option.  Try Fairmont, Westin, Kempinski, Hyatt, or Oriental would persurade expectation level - to 'the Raffle's standard'",
Setiabudi,"If your looking for a luxury hotel in Jakarta, then you won't go wrong with Raffles   The rooms are well furnished and large and have a luxury feel.  Breakfast and Room Service is of a very high standard   The Pool area is quiet and has good facilities.   The only issue would be the lack of decent restaurants and bars, the main restaurant is quite stale and the writers bar is always quiet and seems like an after thought, but due to the location there are many decent restaurants and bars close by.  Last but not least the staff service is excellent.",
Setiabudi,"I have stayed in hotels around Jakarta and raffles is by far the best. In terms of hard product and service, they surpass other hotels, four seasons do not even come close.   Their facilities are amazing, well equipped gym, pool, jacuzzi and even tennis courts. The service is top notch. U have a butler to take care of your requests and you reach him/her by text on whatsapp. Room is spacious, clean and modern. I stayed in artiste suite. I love how attentive and detail oriented the hotel is, they even wrap the cables of lamps etc....   The staff are all very accomodating, professional. They deserve every praise I could give them. Keep up the good work and do not hesitate choosing to stay in Raffles.",

Setiabudi,"1. It was located in Jakarta's Golden Triangle, Kuningan, South Jakarta. It was also accessible by Transjakarta, and soon by LRT. The building was surrounded by many office buildings, shopping centers (Plaza Festival, Setiabudi One, Kuningan City, Lotte Shopping Avenue, and Kota Kasablanka), and also a sports center (Plaza Festival). The hotel itself was located on top of The Gama Tower, with a special lobby apart from the office’s lobby. The main lobby (Sky Lobby) was located on the 52nd floor. They also had a Spa, Gym, and Swimming Pool on the 50th floor, and a restaurant on the 51st floor.  2. The room was so large, spacious, clean and cozy with a modern interior design.

The lobby is located in the 52th floor, once arrived at the floor you will be greeted by 360 degrees view of the city.  Check-in process was quick and smooth, the reception even gave us an upgrade to a bigger room in a higher floor. Requested dowel decoration for my wedding anniversary was not present but it was normal because of the room upgrade. In return, the hotel gave us a surprise cake!  The room was huge! Plenty of space for our kid to run around. The room have a walk-in closet to store all our luggage, hanged clothes, and stuffs. Bathroom was also huge with separate bath tub and shower.

Setiabudi,"The service was great, overall room is spacious and comfortable.  The gym and pool facilities are good. With less people there, it was quite comfortable to use even during this time.   The food and service in lounge was great. Much better taste than breakfast. And the staff were mostly helpful and friendly.    However, other than those, a lot of things need improvement.   Food was quite dissapointing especially during breakfast. Taste was minimal, not a 5stars hotel quality. They also served the wrong order and then informed that they can't serve me the right menu because it will take some time to make it. They did give me few pastries to make up for it"".

Setiabudi,"The Grove Suites is located in the Epicentrum Superblock---a master planned development with shops, restaurants and green space to enjoy.  It is also just minutes away from major business and entertainment districts in Mega Kuningan and the Sudirman Business District.  I have been in and out of Indonesia for much of the last five years and The Grove Suites is my home away from home.""  The suites are oversized and spacious and even include a small kitchen area for longer stays.  The property includes a large pool, spa, restaurant, mini-gym and a musholla.  The best part of staying here, however, is the great service provided by the staff.  They are gracious and attentive....and do a great job of making guests feel welcome.""",
Setiabudi,"The location of this hotel is in kuningan area, famous business and entertainment center of Jakarta. The room is unique and big, like apartment with living room and kitchen. They also provide the kitchen set, including electric stove, so we can cooking in our room. But too bad, the breakfast is so standard in taste and not many variation comparing with other hotels in the same starr classification.",
Setiabudi,"more menu breakfast, western menu en more...........the room unit model is very artistic modern minimalist.....overall service is very satisfying one of the best options for a relaxing stay.......highly recommended to stay again",
Setiabudi,"I took my family to staycation at the Grove for 3 days and 2 nights. The apartment have a cozy living room, with the dining room and open space kitchen, so we all feel very close to each other. The kitchen have stove but we can not cook in here, they plugged off the gas. The outside ambience is quiet good for morning walks, and near the Epiwalk mall, so you don't have to be afraid of running out of food and beverages.",
Setiabudi,"I'm enjoy with all facility the hotel and i Will to come again with the others family. Very nice experience, but i can not swimming because any protokol health about Corona virus. Thanks for all service",
Setiabudi,"overall the services are very excellent, if only citadines have a instrumental / music in every floor of them, it would very great to repel out silent & fearful.  oh the other minus is the room isnt soundproof but thats not a big problem. thankyou",
Setiabudi,"Clean room, Good interior and ambience, Friendly staff, good service, and strategic place, very recommended to staycation or business meeting, traveling or family. the rooms are quite spacious for a very affordable price.",
Setiabudi,"Citadines located right at the central one of the busiest office street in south Jakarta, right next to the one of the most expensive hospital, close to food plaza, just 5 mins walk to busway station. Room size is big, it has 2 electrical stove,nice couch and good internet connection,   one thing they need to fix immediately is one of their elevator which has been out of service for more than a month already!",
Setiabudi,1 lift on 2 was under maintenance. 2 lifts are already not enough for this high building. Only 1 elevator working with limited occupency due to social distancing is making  huge waiting time. this hotel seems also not having lift for service. The staff and luggage service are using the only lift available. Indonesian traffic jam.. ;-)    Also many very small ants in room coming after 5pm...,
Setiabudi,"I've just stayed at Citadines Rasuna for 1 night, however it was absolutely memorable and enjoyable. The staffs were helpful with the fast actions, the location was so great, much more great things. And this is it, the room was completely pleasurable and suitable with the mood. At the certain thing, i will return to stay there in the future.   Thanks for everyone there  Personally say thanks to Mr. Atta (Duty Manager).   Growing greater and bigger for Citadines Rasuna",

Setiabudi,"my room was spacious, but too litle amenities available inside. There was a table, but no chair. The wall was not soundproof, I could clearly hear every detail of the conversation from the next room. Overall, it was a good stay.",

Super love the rooftop pool, spent 2 evenings there just sitting and looking at the sunset and had a nice swim.   The food was great...nasi bakar n iga gorengnya enak banget. altho the scramble and omellette needs improving,but other than that i enjoyed the food.",
Setiabudi,"The location of this hotel is near business area of Jakarta. Many restaurants around this hotel. The room is standard but big enough. The pool, gym, and spa is closed during pandemi. The breakfast is not many variations.",
Setiabudi,"I was stayed at JS Luansa #2005, checkin with Pak Hendra, however his kinda not friendly enough such as not inform me well regarding Hotel facilities, “He inform me room number, WiFi, non smoking room and fine IDR 1.000.000 if I smoke inside the room only” instead of restaurant for breakfast, I asked him “how if i want have breakfast?” and he said “Sorry your room without breakfast ((Without smile, I know he used mask but I can see from His eyes))” I mean yes I absolutely know and notice but again you have inform me well regarding your breakfast and etc etc!

Setiabudi,"I had read good reviews about the Oakwood hotel chain and hence decided to stay at Oakwood Premier Cozmo in Jakarta when I was here for my business trip. However, I was totally disappointed with the experience I had during my stay.  Firstly, it seems that the hotel has not been able to enforce their so-called"" COVID-19 safety protocols. There were times that I saw other guests not wearing mask in the lift or even at the main lobby, which was just in front of the reception counter!   Secondly, although I was staying on a non-smoking floor because I have bad allergy to cigarette smoke, I could always detect cigarette smoke smell in my apartment. Despite highlighting to the hotel staff, they were unable to stop this from happening. They would always give excuses that they had""",
Setiabudi,"Our family hasn't had a travelling or go for holiday since this pandemic. So, as the children start to bored at home, I decided to have staycation, and we choose to stay at Oakwood Premier Cozmo for the long holiday on August 2020,because the location is strategic, near lots of mall, and restaurant. Good ambience to have a walking and running activities, doing groceries, etc. At that time, we had 2 bedroom Suites. The room is so large, with a big window so we can get a good sunlight from outside, and the furniture, is very clean, neat, tidy, feels like a 5 stars home. The kitchen and the cooking utensils are very hygiene, all wrapped in plastic and sealed. And for our protection, Oakwood allowed us to have breakfast at the room. It such a great experience spending our long",
Setiabudi,Great experience for staying in this apartment for two nights. Breakfast was so great and the rooms were clean and comfort. The reception was also great and it located in a strategic area in Jakarta. Recommended for everyone who need a satisfaction vacation with families.,
Setiabudi,"My second stay at this property. Coronavirus chaos happening on the outside, perfect harmony inside the property.   Everywhere I went throughout the hotel, I was met with a smile, and a 'could I help with anything'. The food, rooms and levels of service are second to none.  The staff could not do enough to ensure I expereicned the perfect stay.",
Setiabudi,"I stayed for two nights and booked an Executive room. The check-in process was quick and no-nonsense, which I appreciated. However, I didn't get recognition as a member of Marriott Bonvoy programme (I did get the recognition the next day through the app, though). Upon entering the room, I was amazed by the surprise the hotel team had prepared for me, including the drawings on the window and a complimentary cake. The room was somewhat smaller than expected and the furniture were kind of dated design-wise but they didn't greatly affect the comfort level of the room (in fact, I enjoyed staying in my room, reading books by the window while sipping a cuppa or merely watching TV).  The bathroom was okay. It had a good-size bathtub. The shower area wasn't super spacious but that wasn't",
Setiabudi,"I chose to stay in JW Marriott to celebrate my mom’s birthday, my bro’s birthday and my wed anniversary.   1st disappointment A week before, I texted the hotel to request for birthday decoration for my mom, so it would be ready when we arrived at room. However, it didn’t happened. We arrived and no decoration. A minute later, 2 staffs rang the bell and asked whether we want our room to be decorated. Of course, we said NO, because the surprise sensation was no longer there, my mom was in the room already. And another reason is, it’s pandemic, we wouldn’t let strangers come to our temporary place for doing the decorations.  2nd disappointment Our decision to stay during pandemic was tough. We dare to stay because it’s JW Marriot, a 5 star hotel. We thought that their protocol",
Setiabudi,"Was staying here for two nights: 6 to 8 November at Room #1101.  Great room, with complete amenities and Hygiene set (includes Disposable mask and glove, hand sanitizer). Room was perfectly cleaned and great room service.   Beautiful Bathroom with Bathtub, powerful hot shower. No complain at all for the room.   However, the selection for breakfast should be much improved. Many stalls but with same food selection. Breakfast was limited only for 45 minutes (with batch card given during the check-in). I didn’t think it was for the protocole, since you would find a very full and packed restaurant during that given time. Shoud be considered if you want to have your breakfast here.",
Setiabudi,This is our first trip back to Indonesia since the world pressed the pause button and we were immediately reminded why this is a home away from home. We were checked in by Anya at the front desk who was a pleasure to speak to and the level of hospitality she delivered far exceeded our expectations.  We spent our one night taking advantage of all the amenities of the hotel from the pool to the well equipped gym and finally a lovely meal with drink in the executive lounge.  Thank you Anya and all the lovely gentlemen in the executive lounge for making our layover feel like it’s own mini holiday.,

The room was so clean and comfort, the foods are so good and delicious i love it, and the staff is so nice especially Ms.Anya is very patient  and fast handling when we need a lot of help but she very enthusiastic in handling guests, i am so appreciate it. Thank you JW Marriot for the nice place, foods, and the staff.",
Setiabudi,"Having great stay here. Suggest not using pool at sunday morning if you want to enjoy peaceful swimming, many came with kids. Breakfast and cleanliness was superb. But what I love the most is the staffs that were so full of dedication to give the best for the customer. Recommended. The minus is the location which you can't just walk to shopping mall or restaurant, about 10 minutes to kota kasablanka mall by car (no traffic jam).",
Setiabudi,"I had such an amazing experience staying at Gran Melia, their services were excellent, I even got a surprised birthday cake delivered to my room by the staff and a simple celebration. I'm so grateful and they did make my birthday so memorable.",
Setiabudi,"Decent and polite service with limited offer due to the existing restrictions. Very good hygienic protocols. Stayed in this hotel multiple times in 2019, was sad that the offering is reduced, hope to see that the Spa services are back soon.",

Setiabudi,"As we had reunion of family. Aryaduta is 3 bedroom apartment are big enough to accommodate 3 family (6 adults and 3 kids) living room and kitchen are big enough. Breakfast is too way crowded, small space, food variety is good enough.  Receptions is not too friendly and helpful even need to speak with duty manager to solve. Overall good hotel apartment and good location.",
Setiabudi,"The overall stay was ok, need to improve on staff attitude and room cleanliness. Also I was wondering that you should keep open the In Room Dining a bit late, since it was Ramadhan period and some guest might request food after breakfasting time.",
Setiabudi,"Appreciate and highly thanks for all Services been provider, I Will highly recommended to my friend when they visiting Jakarta so they can enjoy it as I got from this hotel. I hope someday I could stay here with easy process even if I would using another way",
Setiabudi,"A good stay for Jakarta if you are searching for middle class stay with a good connection to the city centre.  Like the Aryaduta Hotel it need to be refurbished. It's not a classy hotel but an apartment complex. We had a two bedroom apartment. It comes along with two bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.   The staff is super friendly and helpful. We had an issue with an AC and it was fixed within minutes.  We mostly choose to stay with Aryaduta when we are in Jakarta also because of the breakfast. it's a huge selection of Indonesian and international dishes.  This Hotel comes along with a pool and a playground, that our daughter loved to use.  A small mall is around the corner and a MRT station is close within an 5 minute walk. So you can reach the city centre without any",

As a result of a recent lockdown impose in Jakarta, some of the services were suspended, for example there is no buffet breakfast, the breakfast will be delivered to your room every morning. The club lounge service was also suspended. The room service menu was cheap, but the choice were limited.   The room was cleaned on my 2nd night, in order to prevent close contact between guests and housekeeping staffs.   Despite all the limitation, the hotel tried to maintain the well quality service. They provide the Duty Manager hotline, so I can ask him anytime for assistance. The response was prompt.   Overall, I can say that the hotel was struggle to maintain quality,",

Tanah Abang,"Next please dont put me on 13th floor, because my little girl saw shadow in the room, and she is crying and want to going down. She is scare and finally she is going down with her mother to report to duty manager on the lobby.",
Tanah Abang,"Booked this hotel because from the flash sale of an online travel ecommerce. The protocol was being applied. The security checked our body temperature. The front office staff aren't really friendly, but they were very clear on telling the regulation and hotels details. the old vibes are very strong felt in the elevator, the keycard was'nt for tapped, instead we needed to slide inside the machine. The room is good, very clean, no strange odor. The bathroom is okay, the amenities just okay. At that time, the kids were disappointed because the pool was closed. According to the staff, it was closed due to Covid-19. So we were just spending the time at the room.",
Tanah Abang,"I have been to quite a few countries, But Jakarta Mulliuen Hotel was impressive with the Hospitality was outstanding with Service the meet more than my expectations, The Front Team was superb in my service to get a shoe, Shopping for friends and restaurants and taxi and moped usage, every time I left my room which was cleaned with lemongrass and the Hallways also. they asked about a breakfast upgrade and Cocktail event each day was divine! God Bless  all of them!!",
Tanah Abang,"Location is amazing.Only few minutes from Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia. Only 2min from metro station. Hotel staff is very polite specially at front desk. It was quick check in no waiting at all. Room was very comfortable,only comment regarding the view. Very clean and spacious enough. Breakfast  nice and fresh. I reccomend this property.It is real value for money.",
Tanah Abang,"Stayed here by myself for a night. Check in was quick, the quickest I've ever experienced. Room was small but warm and didn't feel packed at all. Bed was comfortable, but the pillows were STINKY. I can guarantee that it's not me, because",
Tanah Abang,"We are arrived around 12 PM, and we can check in on that time without waiting till 3PM. Thanks to Shella in the reception for your kind help! They still keeping the protocol to keep the distance and hygiene",
Tanah Abang,"i really had high hopes with this hotel. i mean look at all their pictures! blue, bright and inviting! turns out it was not that great experience.  i checked in there around 4pm, being asked whether i wanted a twin or a double. i picked double room when bought the voucher, why bother asking me again? anyways, i was told only smoking room left for double. i was like, its okay, it wouldnt be that bad.  it was that bad.  the second i stepped out of the lift, i could smell the smoke terribly fill up the hallway. when i entered the room, it was totally humid, and full of secondhand smoke.   the blue carpet was a tad wet. the AC was already on but it didnt breath fresh air. i was thinking it will take times.   the bathroom was okay. took a shower. the shower was horsepower not",
Tanah Abang,"Great stay, very helpful staff - Fajar! Recommended. Good location in the center of Jakarta. Near to many shopping center, MRT stations, restaurants, etc. Reasonable price in thamrin area. Keep the good work!",
Tanah Abang,"I really like the location of this hotel. Very strategic, close to the airport train, MRT and CL.  The staff is very friendly and very helpful. I stayed in the thematic junior suite room. The room is very comfortable. I really like the aromatherapy which makes the room always smell good.  Skyloft restaurant is very comfortable, the food is also delicious. The atmosphere at night is very beautiful with a city view.",
Tanah Abang,"Rest and dine at all seasons very much WORTH IT! Moreover, the service of the Banquet/Restaurant staff, Mas Rofiq, is very friendly and warm.  as well as the Chef on duty at night, received complaints well and educated the kinds of broths used, plus were given delicious complimentary gifts.   One that needs to be IMPROVED ... the room sheets and blankets need to be repaired because they are torn and not suitable, some look old.",
Tanah Abang,"The location of this hotel are magnificent. Near convenient transit point in Jakarta, which include MRT station, Commuter Line Station, Airport Railink Station & BRT Bus Shelter. They also offer great Jakarta's downtown view. The check-in & security check during the pandemic was fast & appreciated. The hospitality are something we whould appraise as well. The only dissapointment we got is the bedroom was a bit dirty, especially the window and floor part. We have toddler so we are pretty much well-detailed about this one. The rooftop restaurant is the highlight of this hotel.",
Tanah Abang,"This is my second visit in this hotel and i am happy this time. Some shortfalls happening during my stay which regarding to room type and room set up + cleanliness but it was rectified immediately by Bunga/MOD on that day.. Many thanks to you, we will be back again next time.. :)",
Tanah Abang,"We had a pleasant stay at All Seasons, because it is very convenient to the MRT Jakarta (very close), KA Bandara / Airport Railink and KRL Commuter Line, and Blora tunnel, a place with mural and fascinating lighting.  Staff were polite and helpful, social distancing applied. The room is bit small, toilet doesnt have wall, but seperated between shower room and toilet room. Double bed is bit narrow. (I suggest you to ask the view to Sudirman)   Breakfast is in the room, delivered by staff from restaurant because COVID19, I order some sunny side up egg and bread, a little glass of juice and water. Just average taste.  Parking lot is not huge, and the elevator is not working at the moment so you must take a stair to lobby, hopefully All Seasons will turn on the elevator/lift right",
Tanah Abang,"We stayed at bright room for four days. The corner room view was excellent, view from above jalan sudirman . The room is clean. The hotel in very good location, close to the shopping mall, gelora bung karno. Breakfast was nice with a lot of choice and hot drinks. Definitely will stay at this hotel again when need a room in jakarta.",
Tanah Abang,"At first i disappointed with their service due when i come to check in around 2.15 PM, the room wasn't ready and i need to wait until 3.30 PM to get my room ready. And the reception also informed that the facility like pool and gym was closed due the pandemic. After waited for more than 1 hours i got my room and the room was spacious and modern facing the sudirman street, semanggi and senayan. My room on 47th floor. And i really love the room because full of glasses. In the next day i run to GBK stadium, and after that i ask the reception is it possible to see the pool, she said yes but the pool was closed but when i arrived at pool, the pool is open there are other guess swimming and i asked the pool staff he said the pool is open. Whaaattt??? How come reception misinformed",
Tanah Abang,I stayed here during the pandemic. I love the fact that the bedsheets are replaced daily and the room is wiped thoroughly. The towels were also replaced daily. In addition the restaurants in the mall downstairs are starting to open which is really convenient so no need to go far away to look for snacks and meals.,
Tanah Abang,"NEVER STAY HERE. Almost $100 for tiny rooms, inedible breakfast, dirty small pool, hot smelly gym, etc. The location may seem good when you book but wait until 5am on a Sunday morning when they are loud alarms and bands and screaming on the street outside. You will not get any sleep at this hotel.",
Tanah Abang,"I have booked a lot of stays for my business trips in Jakarta with Harris Suites fX Sudirman and fortunately I can safely say that they keep improving themselves in terms of room condition and services. The two topmost floors now have better rooms (e.g. multiple international electric plugs, better interior visual, better internet connection) and now they have massage service as well. That being said, the primary reason for me to often book here is the location.  However, there are some things they need to give more attention. The first one is that the Pay at hotel (Credit Card guaranteed)"" payment option when you book via their website is occasionally gone. The second one is that their Simple Business Package oddly only available for Harris Room type and the Harris Bright room""",
Tanah Abang,"Room is super clean and neat, bathroom is awesome, tons of tv channel options, cafe upstairs with plenty of delicacies , and i personally love the room design! 100% would go back to this hotel in the future!  Of course, Receptionist are nice and helpful too!",

Tanah Abang,"Booked a superior room with a pretty good outdoor view. Got a good indulgence with their lovely-packaged amenities and all.  The staffs were nice and quite informative of the area or facilities, however one small setback the floors were not too clean and some of the interiors were a bit dusty. Highly appreciate it if the management could look into the hygiene problem because it can be quite inconvenient.",

One day before check-in i asked them if they could decor my room and they said they could help display our pictures on TV and a pair of towel swan on our bed. They also gave us a fruit platter!!! Their check in time is at 2 pm, however i got there early and luckily our room was ready by then. I was so happy because i needed to put my surprise gift for my fiancé and some artifical rose petals as decoration. Special thanks to Miss Jessyca, she was very helpful and lovely.   Food: 6/10 We ordered nasi goreng kampung and omelette for breakfast. However they got our order wrong. Instead of nasi goreng kampung, they gave us nasi goreng oriental. Both fried rice and omelette were cold. Would have tasted better if",
Tanah Abang,"Stayed here for short vacation to Jakarta. The room was very clean and completed also with huge smart screen. You can also order tasty and variety in room breakfast, since the local government close the all dinning services and only serve the takeaway foods and drinks.

When we checked in, the security welcomed us and helped us with the luggage. He checked our temperature and reminded us to use hand sanitizer placed at the entrance before entering the main door. When we checked in, I need to fill up the declaration COVID 19 form (awesome !).

Male Reception was not so helpful and looks like no emphaty also, very bad experience.",
Tanah Abang,"I have a huge expectation with this hotel because, first it located on “golden route” sarinah & tanah abang, side to side with holiday inn and kosenda which is good hotel, and have a higher rate than juno hotel that already have a good room. But when i went there i was disappointed. The room is dirty that makes me request to change the room. And the new room only made a bit difference. The room wall is so dirty, broken closet and the linen is not clean. The only good thing about this hotel is only it’s location.",
Tanah Abang,The service is quick and simple for reception. Clean and friendly staff for services. Recomended hotel for staying a view days in center city. We hope will be back again. Biggest mall in thamrin nearest by the hotel just walk,

Menteng,"From the beginning while entering the Hotel Indonesia Kempinski building, we felt the warmth welcome from the hotel staff. The elegance and luxury of the interior also makes the feeling soar. Service at the front office is fast and pleasant. Likewise when entering my spacious and luxurious room. When entering the bathroom area, you can feel the luxury of this hotel, a large bathtub and a very luxurious closet that is fully automatic. Toiletries are very complete, and unlike other hotels that limit drinking water for guests, here we are offered to add drinking water if it feels not enough. Giant towels, it is sometimes troublesome to use because they are heavy. The small thing that feels lacking is writing tools, if at the Apurva, Kempinski, Bali it is equipped with beautiful",

Menteng,"Hotel Indonesia Kempinksi has just popped up into my mind when I think where to spend my special day. Providing spacious room with bathtub and exquisite food, Hotel Indonesia Kempinski was welcoming me with unforgettable birthday wish.  However, it would be nice if in the future this hotel also provide music player, so that we, as a guest, are able to enjoy the staycation as nowadays people are rarely watching television.",
Menteng,"As a discovery black member, this is my favorite place to stay when i go to Jakarta. Its near Grand Indonesia Shopping Mall.. and The OKU Restourant is a must try when you stay there. The staff and the manager are friendly. I stay more than 20 nights this year.. so far i have excellent experience.. even sometimes the hotels have troubles, but the staff manage troubles quickly, and give me compensation.   So its a 5/5 star hotel experience.",
Menteng,"We stayed as a family with toddler (1.5 years) for 3 nights in Oriental Suite Room.  The room was huge (95 sqm) consisted of livingroom and bedroom with a huge bathroom. We could feel that the room was quite old but nevertheless still classy and well maintained. The furniture and bedding were top notch, no complain whatsoever in that regards.  The bathroom amenities were Acqua Di Parma which was one of our favorite, and to our surprise, by staying in a suite we got the big bottles which is very satisfying.   Of course the main advantage of getting room at Mandarin Oriental Jakarta was the view and what a view it was! We got two vistas, one overlooking the welcome monument and the other Jalan Sudirman. For the price it offered, we believe Mandarin will give you the best bang for",
Menteng,"We stayed for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary and was pleasantly delighted.  - We were delighted by the anniversary decoration that was prepared beforehand. There were balloons, banners, bed decorations and cakes prepared - We stayed during COVID pandemic with our almost 2 year old daughter but is pleased with the COVID prevention. There were hand sanitizers, room were sealed after disinfected. Pool and breakfast restaurant is limited using periodic slots. Food is still buffet style but served and taken by the waiters so it is safer. - The room itself is facing the HI fountain and was great view  - An improvement that maybe I can give is that the amount of waiters might be insufficient to serve everyone (we dined at Lifeng as well), probably because of layoffs and cutoffs due to",
Menteng,"As always always always. Never disappointing.. this has been my more than 3 times stays ib this past 3 months in MO, and we even planned to stay here again in the next month. Even in this pandemic situation they keep safety protocols first. Such as in room breakfast to avoid crowd in the restaurant, queueing system for the gym and swinng pool facility, it's not easy but they managed to do it well, we always feel safe during our stay in MO. Btw if you're planning to bring your bicycle, they will also let you put it in the concierge. Best experience always. Thank you MO.",

This hotel served breakfast which is packed in bento box. the box inside was rice with chicken, scrambled egg, veggies and fruits. It looks yummy ... but we usually didn't take rice in the morning. so sorry we have to leave the remaining food.  For suggestion, I guess its better to make breakfast optional  and ask to the guest when they check in since .. not all the",
Menteng,"The location of course! The hotel is clean also. I slept in superior room, basic but all you need is there. Staffs are friendly, the security, the receptionists, the housekeeper did also their job very good. Special credit for Inggrit at the reception.

In my holiday, I almost never stayed at standard room (more than 90%), and this stay, was extra ordinary. The staffs are super. Very sincere and the hospitality shown, is top notch flaw less. The experiences was started even before we checked in, even before I upgrade the room. The staff help me smuggled"" the flowers, our wedding pictures and disinfectant them then put them in the suite. They also added some decoration. Ms Kenny, Ms Aurora and Mr Arief were helping me during the surprise preparation.  During the stay, all are superb. The service, hospitality, sincerity all at the highest standard. They even well arranged the taxi for my morning""",

Menteng,We arrived to a quiet hotel at the start of the Covid Crisis. The staff was very attentive while we were there. The restaurant was magnificent and the pool grounds are resort style. Security is top notch. The bedding was delightful. We found it to be centrally locates and across the street from a train stop on the local transportation. This hotel is 100 % accessible.,
Menteng,"1. Great service from the staff. Specially the FO(Ms Aurora thanks for the cookies and Ms Milla), Concierge, pool, and waiters who delivered my food. Also the doorman, security and the other staff.  2. Great taste for the food (beside bf, I also ordered for lunch and dinner) but maybe you need put a pen or pencil for writing in bf card before hanging in front of the door.  3. The room cleanliness, very good.  4. Wi-Fi connection need more improvement, more fast I think.  5. The pool? Fyi, if you want to swimming at the pool. You need booked first at concierge, because the pool allowed only 57 pax due to social distancing.  Overall, 9,5 for your score. Thanks for your services 😊",

Menteng,"Artotel is just like its name. The room interior is minimalist, industrial type and full of art. Very nice, cozy, and suitable for honeymoon, babymoon or staycation with family. The location is also strategic, it's across Sarinah Thamrin, near Jl. Sabang. The neighbourhood is full of restaurant, there's Hongkong Cafe, Bakmi GM, Total Fruit Store, and Pisa Cafe. You can just walk to reach there. And if you stay on the weekend, you can easily join the car free day every Sunday morning.",
Menteng,"I knew Artotel for its artsy experience as well as good hospitality for a competitive price.  For the record, this is a long due review. Hopefully things already better now.  First of all, it is a common understanding that check-in time is at 2 PM or the latest by 3 PM. By the time I arrived at 4 PM, surprisingly receptionist informed me that the room wasn't ready.  Another note on the reception staff, I was not being greeted like any normal hotel staffs would do when guests arriving at the premise. Maybe he was tired, no smile at all.  Fortunately, it didn't take a long wait for us to check-in into our room.  When I entered the room. It was okay, but the cleaning wasn't thorough. I spotted several area covered in dust a bit and a bit of litter around table near the window.",
Menteng,"It was my second visit (the first one was in late May 2018). I booked the Studio 20 unit for a night, just like my first visit. However, this time I asked for a room with a double bed instead of twin beds. The interior was, as expected, artsy and funky. The furniture items were great and the working chair made a twist to my visit (due to its shape, I thought the chair was broken but it was just the structure). Having a room on the 6th floor, I could enjoy a better view this time. However, TV channels disappeared a couple of times and I had to turn the TV off to get them back. The bathroom was just fine. No objection.   The check-in process was quick and easy. Staff members were helpful, especially the front-liners. I also visited BART to have some drinks and this time, the staff",

Another nice thing my room always got upraded. The accomodation itself also great such as wide and nice room, comfy bed, every corner is clean and neat. And when it comes to breakfast time, the food also tastes good even tho not much options has to offer. Nevertheless every aspect really hit me well. Definitely would come back stay there again. See you soon Novotel Jakarta Cikini 😊",
Menteng,"Room    We were staying in 1 bedroom executive unit facing north with Monumen Nasional view. The room includes a small kitchen with basic cooking utensils and laundry machine in the bathroom with a bathtub. Even though we were enjoying our stay, I think there are still room for improvements There are some minor stains on the wallpapers, lacking of power outlet can be a challenge, there were mold inside their double pane glass which is ruining the view, and the bathtub drain was not working (management team quickly fixed this for us).    Note that although the north side have a better view, it is also facing a bright large LCD billboard that runs all day and night, if you are sensitive to light you might want to consider other views.   Location    Getting into the hotel can be a",

Menteng,"We booked penthouse in Fraser last weekend for our wedding holy matrimony in the church nearby. All of the staffs were really responsive. We also ordered lunch for our family from Relish Bistro . Our family loves the food, so tasty and cooked with good quality of ingredients. Special thanks to Pak Marky dan Pak Yuri for all your support! We definitely will come back :)",
Menteng,"We stayed at the penthouse for 2 nights and we really love the hospitality. The staffs are very accommodating and pleasant, especially Mr.Yuri. They got a good view of the city, nice ambiance, and clean. I would totally recommend this place to family & friends.",
Menteng,"Stayed here to celebrate my kid’s bday. Satisfied bgt, the penthouse is soooooooo spacious, pas bgt utk family event, untuk stay di dalam rmh during this pandemi. Sebelumnya unit didesinfektan dulu, dibersihkan setiap hari, and the most important, lengkap bgt cutleriesnya, bersih dan sgt terbantu bgt dgn pelayanan frontlinernya yg helpful from the day one, Mas Yuri. Will be back again for sure on the NYE!",
Menteng,I had a short staycation here but the experience were great enough in a cheap and small hotel like Erian (despite the location in Menteng). I booked at midnight and checked in at 3 a.m. but the staff was helpful and fast so I could rest as soon as i came. Room was good. But might be too small if family staycation was your intention. Didn't try the breakfast because i had to checkout early in the morning.,
Menteng,"The hotel is very clean and fragrant, all the staffs (even the securities and technicians!) are very friendly and proactive. The breakfast are delicious. What I admire most are they provide water in glass bottle, and they provide bicycles to stroll around. Keep up the great job.",
Menteng,"Stay there for 3 days with my family. Book family room, the room is very big, nice minimalist design, lots of tv channel, nice bathroom, complete amenities. All of the staff is very friendly and professional. Breakfast is very good, lots of varieties and taste good. They have meeting rooms and rooftop bar is under construction, cant wait to see the rooftop bar. Keep up the good work.",
Menteng,"I was looking for somewhere fairly central to stay in Jakarta. Menteng is a good option, and the Erian deserves its good reviews. It’s modern, spotlessly clean and well managed.   The room was comfortable. Nice touches like hand towels, decent toiletries, refillable drinking water. There’s a safe and the aircon works well. Good WiFi. Only one thing missing really - a hair dryer would be useful.  Breakfast was better than I expected, with enough choices and variation to stop you getting bored.",
Menteng,"Having come from a horrible hotel in Medan, Sumatra, the Erian Hotel was a treat. Our room was simply furnished and quite small but was really clean, with a great bathroom.   We were only here for one night, and I was looking forward to breakfast. There appeared to be a lot of choice but there wasn’t much available. It wasn’t until I’d had a couple of croissants that a lady appeared outside and began cooking omelettes, sadly it was time to leave and I missed out.",
Menteng,"Very friendly staff (served by Mr. Putra), rooms are clean, and spacious, according to expectations, bathrooms are spacious and clean.  very good service.

Menteng,"For anybody who still worry to do some staycation for yourself or for your family, i have to say Grand Hyatt as a 5 star hotel, definetely gave the best standard to handle this kind of virus, from the entrance till the room, everything are well prepared. Thank you Grand Hyatt for your amazing service with amazing promotional rate. Stay safe and keep healthy!",
Menteng,Excellent service. Spacious rooms. Mesmerizing room view. Clean rooms. Pandemic precaution in place. Relaxing stay. Breakfast was lovely. Family friendly. Pool was under renovation but can't wait until the renovation is complete. Five star staycation.,
Menteng,"Grand Hyatt should be the grandest of all Hyatt property. In Jakarta, this property is iconic and located above the luxury Plaza Indonesia Mall and facing the Bundaran HI. I really had very high expectation about this hotel.   The lobby is grandeur and huge. Check in was no hassle, I book the night from Traveloka during their flash sale, so I had a very good rate.   The room itself is large and spacious. But it's just not luxurious and seems old. The bathroom is small, but it has bathtub. What disappointed me the most are the bed. I booked twin bed and stay with my friend. But the twin bed configuration is not really twin bed. It's more like double bed split in the middle. There's no space among the 2 beds, literally sticks to each other. The design is not well thought and",
Menteng,"The staff was very helpful, the service was incredible. Very clean room & nice breakfast. Even though i paid for the promo and got late check out till 3PM! the service beyond expectation. Thank you Grand Hyatt!",
Menteng,"New Experience, when staying during a work meeting at Sari Pasifik Hotel, Parking is quite easy, Employees are quite friendly, very helpful. The Health Protocol is strictly enforced, from entering at the front door there is a digital thermometer, when checking in, and entering the meeting room. Meals are given in the room directly.",

Menteng,"Spent one night here in their newly renovated Grand Deluxe room. Check in process was quick and safe with health protocols applied. The room size was small, if you see from outside the building, one window equals one room. Though small, the newly renovated room was quite nice and comfortable, somehow eliminates the feeling that this is and old hotel.  This hotel already opened the swimming pool for guests, but the other facilities remain closed commonly after the pandemic is over. It's location is strategically located in middle of everything. Food orders and delivery from outside were so cheap and easy.  The breakfast was what disappoints me. Practically no safe distance between tables. The food quality was mediocre with very little choices. We didn't spend our time long during",
Menteng,"The location of this hotel is very strategic.  Right in the middle of business and entertainment area in Jakarta. The building is old enough but classy elegant. I suggest u to choose grand deluxe room for staying in this hotel.  It's a new renovated room with modern interior and equipment. But too bad there is no bathtube in this type of room. They have many facilities such as gym,  swimming pool,  and spa.  But u have to check it first to front desk, because some facilities have adjustment regulation during the pandemi. The breakfast is ok.  Need more variety but the taste is good enough.  The staff also helpfull and friendly.",
Cilandak,"Relaxing Hotel in the Middle of bustling city of Jakarta.. The hospitality, and the politeness of the staff were superb. The room cleaned, and my sons were enjoying the pool.. The breakfast was delicious. Despite the price was relatively cheap, but the the quality was expensive.",

Cilandak,"I spend 2 nights  for staycation  to do work.. The bathroom is quite clean and the soap and shampoo smell good which is my favorite (smells of green tea). In room I can find a set of tea, coffee, sugar, creamer along with a heating pot. There is also mineral water 1L but it's in charge which is I don't like it and pretty shame.   I got back view and there is nothing to see and very dark when its night. The pool not really clean, because many leaves fell in that pool also not given chlorine which is useful as a virus prevention.  They have gym fasilitation, also clean. Public toilet, lobby, restaurants, really love it so comfy, with wood nuances and aglonema ornamental plants along the lobby.   The hotel very near with Cilandak Town Square, and other food station so I'm not",

All the staffs are very helpful and kind. Especially miss Riyanti who helped us to choose a great breakfast, brunch and dinner. Aglio olio, Hainan chicken rice, pizza, fish and chip with tahu udang were delicious and recommended 👌😊👍👍👍👍",

Cilandak,"We had a really nice stay at RA. As we were self quarantined, room service was delivered for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As we are both vegan the cook made us delicious plantbased meals with a lot of variation. Also the rest of the service was wonderful.   The location is allright, though near a big road which is quit loud if you are at the pool.",
Cilandak,WORST EXPERIENCE ! Nothing’s went well!  1. Long wait when check in. We checked in at 2pm but we waited for 1 hour to get our room ready!  2. BAD internet connection. The wifi speed is so frustrating. We stayed in executive suite rooms at 7th floor and the wifi connection is very poor. Even for Telkomsel signal is just 1 bar here.  3. THE FRONT OFFICE NUMBER IS SO DIFFICULT TO BE REACHED! I’m requesting an additional towel and I have to tell them 3 TIMES WITH OVER THAN 5 ATTEMPT TO CALL! My friends decided to goes down to the receptionist for req additional towel but they still didn’t give FAST ACTION! This is so frustrating.   4. The electrical is totally disgusting. In the morning we are using stove and microwave but the electrical insufficient ! The electrical down for more,

Cozy place, great service, and what a beautiful pool. Covid protocol perfectly done, the room was very clean, and they sent me a beautiful noted happy birthday wowww made my heart more happier at that night. They have Rumangsa Coffee at the lobby floor, the coffee was really good and quite cheap, I love it. Thankyou very much Ra Simatupang what a happiest ever staycation.

Cilandak,"Great experience. The suite room (3 bedrooms) are amazing, service are quite nice and informative. The swimming pool is  and photogenic, it also had sitting area beside pool. They also had kids pool and outdoor playground. Breakfast in room is average, we only had bento breakfast (american breakfast in bento box) the sausage was not really good. But overall fine.",
Cilandak,"Whenever I stayed at RA , I’ve encountered difficulties in getting clear and stable tv programs.  It’s quite frustrating, as the tv will freeze or has nothing on the screen for sometimes or few minutes until it willl appear and breaking ups .. i’ve learned that i have to restart the set up box, instead of calling hskp each time to assist .. perhaps you may need yo change the tv cable provider.  Also in some suite rooms I stayed , tv is not available in the bedroom , and only available 1tv at the living room .. so perhaps you need to ensure the room readiness and it’s facilities consistancy.   Thanks ..   I look forward to staying at RA again in the near future ..",

The breakfast are great in taste, really thanks to Chef Ujang and Restaurant staf Hana! theyre so kind and make the most delicious Noodle and fried rice (just like famous streetfood style)  I recommend this hotel, especially if you're ALL-Accor Member!",

Cilandak,"Took 45 minutes to receive our dinner on the day we checked-in and our drinks order was incorrectly provided and alarmingly took 15 minutes to correct. When we chased our dinner order, we were provided a different excuse each time. We then asked to see a supervisor or manager and were told someone would come but no one did - even after we paid. We subsequently complained to the front office and again, throughout our 2 night stay, heard from no one. Unfortunately breakfast the following day was unpleasant, although we arrived around 1 hour before buffet closing, we had to ask the staff to replenish several items such as orange juice, milk and butter. Also, even though I declared my son in our booking (total 3 guests) our room was only provided 2 towels so I naturally requested",

Cilandak,"The Kristal is a fine hotel reminiscent of the 80's and 90's big hotel architecture and theme. Studio suite is large, well equipped with mini kitchen, the king bed is exceptionally comfortable with pillows for all sleeping preferences. The air conditioning works very well and the bathroom amenities are well planned. Laundry turnaround is same day, room service is fast with great food selection and reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, everything from eggs made to order to sushi, Thai, Indian and Western options offered daily. The dining room is quite large with excellent views available of the pool area. The resort style pool offers a swim up bar, extra lounges around the pool would be a plus. The gym is a highlight, extremely large and well laid out with state",
Cilandak,"We used to stay here since 2005, sometimes for months due to relocation. It was always good and a simple but comfortable home away from home. Today those days are gone. I do not know what happened? The staff are no longer motivated, rooms have not changed since 2005, it all looks tired. Prices are too high for what it is now. There are better options in the area for less.  An exemption has to be made for the satu lagi bar, there still seems to be a little vibe and staff seem to have fun in what they are doing. Keep up the good work!",
Cilandak,"It's been a while since my last review. A bit lazy to write, but the hotel ambience worth to review. I visited this hotel on December 2019, after having a long walk in Ragunan zoo. Too exhausted to drive home so we decided to spend one night to relax in this hotel. We chose this hotel coz it only took 15 minutes driving from the zoo. We booked for a 2-bedroom suite. Nothing special on the check-in process. They have two tower building and our room was located on the tower 2. The room is nice and big. Everything is efficiently arrange to create a cozy living enviroment. Eventhough small, the pantry has fridge,cookware hob and hood, dinner sets, microwave, toaster, dispenser and many things so you can prepare your own meal if you are so lazy to go out.  But i am not a big fan of",

I need to call receptionist 3 times for it! I try to ask to move to another room, but they said its full booked, weird thing is, in the middle of the night when i experienced my third shut down, they try to move us to another room! If there’s a room available, why they say full booked before? Shame on you. Just shame.",
Cilandak,"Little Amaroossa Residence is a unique 3 stars hotel. The hotel gives a stylish contemporary design room and good location in South Jakarta. The staffs are helpful and give a good smile. The rooms are spacious, nice designed, has wifi, and clean. The room carpet is vacummed regularly, which is good, free from dust. The price is affordable for a business hotel or family.  Over all, Little Amaroossa Residence is a unique hotel and stylish. Good to stay for family or business.",
Cilandak,"I‘ve spent two nights at this hotel for a business trip. I wasn’t expecting something extraordinary but surprisingly it caught my attention on interior design. I would say much better than plain interior on mostly 3star business hotels chain. Breakfast is also tasty, lot of choices even the chef gave a surprise food tough hahaha, it was a fun moment. I don’t know about some review out there but definitely this hotel is worth your money per night on its class.",
Cilandak,"Room smells old and damp, wall paint smudges, sheets no longer white, bathroom smells. I got the room on the 5th floor, was staying with my son and bought a few big bags. Elevator was on maintenance and none of the staff offered to help bring the bags upstairs. AC was not working properly, asked to move to another room but the staff immediately said sorry but no other room available without asking why I wanted to switch room or offered any assistance. Breakfast was disappointing, coffee was just warm, even when I asked for a hot one they still me the lukewarm one. Was staying there for the sake of a family reception at a nearby restaurant. Would not stay there again for sure. Too disappointing. I've stayed in cheaper hotels with better condition and amenities.",
Cilandak,"This is the first time I came to little amaroosa. All staff is amateur. Checked in is so slow.. I did direct booking through the website with the remarks  King bed&smoking"" but when I checked in I repeat my request to have ' 1 King bed ' and he said ' yes ' in fact,  I got twin bed with adjoining bed without any information upon checked in ( this is terrible ) reception said that ' the bath towel has not ready yet so I have to wait until 19:00 to get the towel ' but I got the towel at 20:00 :'( .  Breakfast is 4/10 even compared with another budget hotel. They don't provide juices. And when I ask for omelete, the staff said "" sorry it's sold out "" and it's just at 8:30am. As I know, breakfast should provide the foods until it closed. This will be my 1st and last time to stay in""",
Cilandak,"The hotel location is in south of Jakarta. The location not very strategic area. Far from downtown. But the hotel facility is Good. They have invinity pool on the roof top. The room is big enough and clean. They provide microwave in every room, but too bad they don't provide plate, spoon, or fork. We have to ask to room service if we need it.",

Cilandak,the hotel is part of an office building. When I came for the first time is make me confused because the office lobby related with the hotel lobby. I've got some complimentary snacks too. The room so clean & neatly with have a small pantry & the staff really humble & helpfully.,
Cilandak,"This hotel is strategically located on Pangeran Antasari south Jakarta. The hotel is part of an office building so you  need to find the lobby on the side entrance. It is still new with limited facilities. There is no restaurant yet accept on the roof top pool bar. Breakfast is served in the lobby with fair variety. The rooms are amazingly good and a small pantry with fridge and microwave is available. I really appreciate their internet tv services, one you don't get much often in other hotels. I am confident that once other facilities are provided, this hotel can become a favorite place for guests working near by office towers.",
Cilandak,"First of all, PSW Hotel is in the same building with PSW Tower. The Room is clean and all the furnitures 85% with gold colour. Looks like really glamour. All the staffs was Humble. I've got some complimentary snacks (available in every rooms). Also they have Oven and Toaster in the Room. Last, This hotel just need a little bit improve for their WiFi. Others, Perfecto!",
Cilandak,"What a beautiful property!  As a female traveling alone I requested transfers via the guest house, round trip from the airport, arriving and departing around midnight.  My ride was there when I arrived.  It took about 40 minutes to get to the property with a cool drive through the city. The hotel is a hidden gem, in a quiet residential area. The lobby is stunning with a grand piano, marble everything, winding rod iron staircase and filled with local hand-made furniture. I was greeted by one of the owners.  She was so welcoming at the late hour.  I had requested a tour the next day and she confirmed everything for me.  I couldn't ask for a better guide.  He took my list of things I wanted to see and we did nearly everything.  His English was flawless.  It was fantastic!",
Cilandak,"Situated in a quiet south jakarta neighorhood, Pesona Guest House is great, comfortable and gorgeous place if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city.

Completely different to staying in any of the regular luxury hotels for all the right reasons.",
Cilandak,"The most I liked was that we upgraded to Family Room, after urgent renovation has to be Done to the next room. Room space were considered VERY BIG/WIDE compare to normal hotel, so convenient for traveler with children and/or plan to have family gathering. Food during Breakfast quite OK, even though some menu were repeated (not change) for 7 days such as bread/cake. Room condition unfortunately while the space wide, need more attention on maintenance & cleanliness, since it was quite OLD already. Fortunately staff greatly response all our request of additional utilities & feedback for immediate improvement. Location luckily quite GREAT too, only around 45mins from airport & 5mins walking distance to CILANDAK TOWN SQUARE which I know the only mall that open until 2AM on",
Cilandak,"outdated room but still fine. we got a higher floor room but in front of our room there was a construction so the corridor become smelly. very bad. the reception is just ok. the telephone in the room is not working properly, we have tell it to reception and they said they will sent engineering to check the problem, but nobody come.... saat sore hari kami menggunakan fasilitas pool tetapi staff bolak balik di area pool sehingga membuat kami tidak nyaman, mereka seperti melihat terus ke arah kami. ada free minibar di kamar. the only thing is just because they have strategic location. Wifi di kamar juga tidak berfungsi dengan baik.",
Cilandak,"The room is outdated but clean. The kitchen is equipped with kitchenettes eventhough it's not complete set but still ok (no knife, no extra plates, no dishwashing liquid). The dining table is a bit old. The bathroom is outdated. No exhaust fan. Overall it's okay.",

Cilandak,A group of us went to Jakarta for a function and stayed here at the Midtown Residence. Such a wonderful location and easy to get around. We used local taxis and even central Jakarta was only a 20min cab ride away. Very reasonable prices for stay and breakfast. Pak Herman and his friendly staff made our group of 5 very welcome. Our room was well appointed with a water dispenser for drinking water as well as a kitchen and washing machine. Plenty of places to eat only a 5 minute walk away. Matahari department store and a great supermarket plus 2 levels of specialty stores at the local mall. We are definitely coming back to stay here next time we are in Jakarta. Thanks to all the staff for making us so welcome.,
Cilandak,"There is no maintenance at all, very dirty sheets, smelly and dusty rooms, and so called breakfast is a plate of “pasta” brought to your room. Who eats plate of cold pasta at brekfast? Even coffee or tea not served with that, forced to use instant coffee powder. Ridiculous. Go ahead and stay if you want to ruin your holiday. A total rip off. A copy paste manager email doesnt make an excuse. 🤣🤣🤣",
Cilandak,"My overall experience was ok. I think what most hotels fail to execute this days are the service that exceed guest expectation. Amaroossa is pretty old, but the room is big enough. Their staff were friendly, especially the security and reception. Not in the breakfast resto, there was no service at all, just saw some staff clear up and wipe the tables. Although the room is big, it needs some renovation for the aircon (noisy and need to wait several minutes to be cold enough). Food was ok, pretty complete breakfast selection. The aesthetic and authenticity factor can be improved, to make the hotel shine even its old. Hope this can be received as a constructive feedback for the hotel.",
Cilandak,"It probably was a luxury hotel years ago, but those times are definitely long gone. When entering the hotel, it is obvious that in order to claim “luxury”, it requires urgent upgrading & improvement.  Besides this, you’ve the highway in front of the hotel and if you’re on a higher floor, it feels as if this highway literally goes through your bedroom.  The pictures from the swimming pool must have been made from one of the best photographers in town, because there is a huge difference from what you see on the advertisements and when you physically stand in front of the pool",
Cilandak,"I only stayed for a short 4 days and was made welcome as I entered the reception area. My booking was attended to efficiently and my preferences attended to. The room was clean, as always and I was provided with fresh fruit on a platter. Management and supervisors were always visible, approachable and unobtrusive. I thoroughly recommend the spa services which uses trained masseurs and again, is excellent value for money. Would I return there? A firm YES",
Cilandak,"For now I want to reviews related our visiting 2 days ago. First, the room temperature is not cold enough.  because the maximum room temperature is only up to 27 degrees. Second, TV broadcast image quality that is less clear. The last breakfast menu that I feel the menu began to decrease if I compare about 6 months ago.  points 1 and 3 that I experience are very different from before. Thank you 🤔",
Cilandak,"The shower fells broken. No hot water. I cannot charge tissue until 08 Am, Air conditioner like very old. The lamp switch also broken, I just wondering about electric shock, But sofar I can enough of sleep :) the rooms like adventure to me. I hope they read this and fix it.",
Cilandak,"We booked a room on a (famous) booking site. It said that our reservation was guaranteed by our credit card and that check-in was until midnight. We arrived after our international flight and 1hr of taxi, at 10 PM. On arrival, the staff tells us that he cancelled the room at 7 PM after trying to reach us (we were in a plane) because he didn't hear from us (even though, again, check-in until midnight and credit card guarantee). We ask for a room anyways but the hotel is full. We ask if our entire stay has been cancelled and he says yes. So, at 10 PM, we have to find another place to stay. We did (Hotel 88 up the street, great service).   At the end of our stay in this other hotel (3 nights), we discover that they charged us for the 3 nights that they supposedly cancelled",
Cilandak,"Strategic location near the Haji Nawi MRT station but it doesn't maximize this advantage with better service. Stains on the wall, dirty carpet, no towel, no window, disfunctioning card. Need to fix and touch up your interior design",
Cilandak,"In my opinion the Maven Fatmawati hotel is a fairly comfortable hotel, compared to other Maven Hotels, with rooms that are quite spacious, with affordable prices that are really suitable for those of you who are looking for a hotel with low budget, plus a check in process and check out. quite fast with excellent service from receptiont ramadan. Thanks for giving me excellent service. I will return to your hotel. See you on my next visit.",
Cilandak,It placed in fatmawati near blok m and there’s construction in front of the hotel so it kinda hidden from the main road. When I was there I got the only room left with very noisy air conditioning. For breakfast you will get fresh the chef gonna cook it for you. But only choose from 2 menu only. Maybe when the hotel full booked they’ll provide buffe,
Cilandak,"Not much to say. It's a small hotel with limited facilities but we are happy with what we got. Near the big road. Easy to find. The biggest problem will be a parking space. It's clean! What suprise me was they provide kitchen and a medium size refrigerator at the room. So if you need a room in the city for longer stay with family, you should consider the hotel.",
Cilandak,"We stayed here for one night and it was very comfort. There was mini pantry in our room, it was superior time. And it was very helpful when you brought toddlers with you on your trip to Jakarta. The price was really worth it and I would like to come back again someday. Keep the good cleanliness.",
Gambir,"For the room is very comfort,food is so delicious, staff in here very friendly and kind like mr Zainal, ms Melly, Ms Laila they are so welcome and gorgeous. I like the atmosphere here..not too crowd. Very recommended hotel in Jakarta.",

The breakfast was quite good, but i was expecting more from 4 star hotel if i compare with other hotel. But for the hotel staff service is really good, even when we ask for several stuff and quite often they always serve us passionately. I'm really recommend this hotel if you want to do staycation.  Thx yuan garden!",
Gambir,"Thankyou for Harris Vertu and Mr zubir for welcoming, so much fun staycation in here, untuk kamarnya cukup besar tp sayang for water heater not work very well, untuk sarapannya juga enak dan banyak pilihan nya, and of course have a good view!!!",

Gambir,"Thanks Harris Vertu, was had bday lunch. recommended places to spent with family and friends. Nice Food, Nice ambiance. Oh ya, all the staff also friendly. ❤️❤️  Will go back next time and experience the rooms.",
Gambir,"Stayed here for one night only. The room was spacious, neat and super clean. Due to pandemic I made sure I cleaned everything before I touch. I cleaned the table with alcohol and tissue, and I found no dust whatsoever, it's super clean. Very impressive. Bathroom was nice, and the soap and shampoo smells really great, wish I bumped into the cleaner's cart so I could take one or two of them! :D Breakfast was nice, nothing fancy, perhaps they reduced the option due to pandemic, but it's totally fine. One little bummer during my stay, I asked for 1 bed, instead they gave me room with 2 beds, except for that everything else is good.",
Gambir,"Everything in this Hotel is cool.. I love to stay there.. The breakfast condiments was perfect, fresh, and the taste so good.. They still have a lot of condiments in breakfast even the occupancy low.. We will back soon..",
Gambir,"Stayed there for a short vacation in Jakarta. Check-in location is the same as Harris Vertue, incl. the breakfast venue (I think it's due to COVID). Room was nice and spacious, and (again) I think it was Harris' as well. Breakfast menu variation was quite limited but tasted good. I enjoyed 'nasi goreng ikan asin'. Lots of restaurants nearby, eg. Ta Wan, Raa Cha (at the same building as the hotel, ie. Harmoni Exchange). Or you can walk outside to some other restaurants also close by, eg. Dunkin Donuts, Eatlah, A&W, etc. You won't starve! Thanks Yello :)",
Gambir,"Located in Central Jakarta and with many infamous food stall/ restaurant within a mile. Surely this hotel is a good choice for who love to eat in their holiday. I booked the suite type for two days and i am amazed when entering the room because it is bigger than the picture i saw in website or tripadvisor reviews. The suite type is like apartment that has a living room with office desk, and minibar. And the other side is bedroom with another tv. Also it has a big windows with a great view, mine got north jakarta view, we can see jakarta sea when there’s no haze (i hoped got the monas view before i checked in but unfortunately it already fully booked lol). But it’s okay since i only got to pay half price ( i got the deal from some OTA’s flash sale). The next day i just realized",
Gambir,"Such a nice stay as i was upgraded to Harris vertu when im booking with Yello rates. Been staying many times in Vertu in the past and this time would like to try Yello to know why this hotel rated full 5 in Tripadvisor rating. But the fact im upgraded to Harris makes this trip even better.  Harris vertu is one of the best Harris i have ever stayed (been staying in Bali-jakarta-bandung-surabaya-solo-semarang-malang). Vertu is superior in every aspect, room cleanliness, design, room comfort and many other aspect.   Next time will try their Yello tho, im cusrious to stay at top rated hotel in Tripadvisor.",

The Fraser Residence suites is such a lovely place with a nice city view. The place was very clean and and very comfortable. The location is perfect to walk anywhere in that shopping, restaurant. The staff were always very kind and eager to help meet our needs. I found Banda to be super kind and helpful.

Gambir,"Hotel Santika Slipi is one of my fave hotel to staycation. The hotel location is very strategic, because it's close to mall, such as Mal Taman Anggrek, Central Park, Grand Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, and Senayan City.  It is also suites for family with children, becase it has a large swimming pool. Children would love it.  The breakfast buffet also has various of menus. And inside the restaurant, there's a children play room, so you don't have to worry if your children a little bit grumpy.  The room is quite big for Deluxe and Superior Type, neat, clean, no carpet, and have a long sofa.  Next to the hotel, there's also padang Restaurant  Sederhana "" and Indomaret for your first help :)""",

Gambir,Hotel is located a short distant from the main highway to Bogor which is ideal for golfers who wants to enjoy Jakarta nightlife and avoid the morning traffic jam going to Bogor golf courses. Room are clean and spacious. Morning breakfast spread is wonderful. You can choose between local dishes and some simple western breakfast. Highly recommended if you're looking for hotel which is  value for money.,
Gambir,"First, I tried to reach the hotel by phone, but the number written on google and OTA is NOT the actual hotel number, it's the head office number. So, they redirected me to another number. Annoying. I checked in to the hotel late at 23.00, there the reception was very good, quick and informative, bravo Mr. Teguh! Then, another trouble happened. Both the key card were not working properly. I gotta inserted the card couple of times to make it works. Got my room at 1605, the room is very spacious, the view is amazing, the bath tub is awesome, until I found the thick dust on the mirror's frame. It's not like a day or two of not being wiped, it's like a whole month. The next morning, I had an amazing breakfast at JP Bistro. Thank you Mr. Hendru who was very responsive to clean up the",
Gambir,"Urging Tripadvisor to remove or deactivate pool and gym activities as available in this hotel. At least after being otherwise confirmed by Aryaduta. I am really DISAPPOINTED and felt misleaded as the listed facilities are closed due to hotel policy. No solutions offered by the front desk as we basically understand that many other hotels actually open its pool and gym. In bahasa: tolong dihilangkan keterangan fasilitas kolam renang dan gym di hotel ini karena meskipun ada tapi sengaja ditutup. Hal ini terjadi pada hari ini, Sabtu 25 Juli 2020. Tolong dilakukan agar customer tidak salah dalam memesan..",

It also gives me many options to public transportation and the most important thing is the staff. I'm also impressed by the staff's service especially from the frontline guys.

Gambir,Great & Excellent and also cheapest hotel in Jakarta.its reasonable price.very kind & helpful staff.breakfast also delicious.Thank you soo much for valuable treating. hotel room also comfortable.highly recommended.,
Gambir,"The building may look a bit old but the rooms are spacious and comfortable. With a proximity to the National Monument and Gambir Railway station and many attractions the hotel makes a good choice, especially so because it is not located on a main road yet accessible easily from main roads.  Rooms are clean and sleep quality is good. Staff are helpful and the King's Cafe down below is a 24 / 7 facility. A place where they coax you to try different food items in quite a warm manner.  A good stay indeed. And they offer free drop at Gambir Station if one so desires.",
Gambir,"Great hotel and great services from all the hotel staff. The hotel was located a bit far from a “live” location but it is so lovely to stay here. No noise from crowd, simple but great foods for breakfast, and the most they are friendly and helpful. They have a free shuttle heading to Tanah Abang so you need to worry. MoNas is just a stone throw from this hotel. Around 15 minutes by walking distance. The foods for in-room-dining are cheap and affordable. Much much love from all of us.",

Gambir,"It was my first stay in Fave Hotel Tanah Abang. When I stayed there it was quiet, I think the occupancy may not be good due to pandemic.  All staffs wore PPE and I had temperature check before entered the lobby. The room was clean, quite small but comfortable. I like the room. Staffs I met were also friendly.  During the pandemic restaurant and room service was only until 6 pm. So I had early dinner then. The food was good. The only minor thing in my opinion was the parking area which was very limited. But luckily they had valet parking which was free.",
Gambir,Our family trip last week we stayed at Fave HotelCideng and we really enjoyed it. Overall the service is very good only the taste should be better and variety of food at the restaurant should be more option,
Gambir,"Budget hotel in a good location in Jakarta. The room is not so big, but enough for a confortable stay. There are some options for eat nearby, such as Starbucks, Mc Donald's, KFC and other local restaurants.",

Gambir,"Our room (Family 2 bedroom apartment) was great for the price paid. However, no access to terrace and main coach / sofas at the living room should be replaced  as they are not clean, and look dirty to use them.  Reception area and restaurant / breakfast normal.

Gambir,"Swimming pool was not clean (as well as windows), air conditioner too loud (all the time), grey towels, dirty sinks in bathroom. Poor customer service, awful hotel decor.  But: Good massage in Spa center, good Chinese food in the restaurant, good WiFi.  Overall, definitely not a 5 star hotel, 2-3 max. Location is not central and far from events/venues/interesting places",
Gambir,It was quite a nice stay. Very friendly personal and a comfort room with everything you need. Big bed inside and a nice bathroom. Downstairs is a little restaurant where you can have some food or just drink something. Would like to stay another night when I go back to Jakarta! :),
Gambir,"The room is really comfortable, clean and cold. The staff is really nice and kind. In the lobby is connecting with Padang Restaurant and in front of the hotel theres Starbucks that wich is good for you to hang out or just take a coffee. So yeaah overall the place, the staff and the place is really good",
Gambir,"To whom it my concern,  I feel satisfied staying at the Maxone hotel.  The rooms are comfortable and always cleaned every day, the staff are friendly, the response is fast when needed, breakfast is varied.  Everything is ok, so there is no reason not to stay at this hotel again when traveling.  One more thing is that its strategic location, close to Starbucks and Padang's food restaurant which is open 24 hours, and close to the busway stop makes it easy for me to hang out while working and makes it easy for me to do activities with public transport.  Thus the results of my review during a stay at the Maxone Platinum Hotel (16-26 Feb 2020).  Br, -Wiwien-",

The room are not big but clean and tidy, too bad the quilt a bit damp during our first night, we ask for a change the nex day and the new one is Ok.   The bathroom are clean, but the ventilation fan is not strong enough to suck the steam during a shower and the steam made the cool room tiles wet all over, and that's unpleasant situation.  The readily available slipper in the room is only a pair, even though the room is intended for two guest.",
Gambir,"The interior is all great based on the rent price. I also have no problem with the cleanliness as well.   But, I am experiencing a full of unpleasant experiences even within 1 hour after I checked in!   First of all, a group of people can enter to inside my room based on their keys! Phewm, fortunately I am still fully clothed and not taking a bath. This family said that they were given the wrong keys by the receptionist.  Next, my Air-Con is not working well. The room was very hot. At the beginning, I thought it's happening in all rooms until I saw a housekeeper cleaning a room in front of mine and realized this room is quite cool.   Then, I asked the receptionist to change the room and they said the hotel was fully booked for double bed and all guests have checked in.  Wow,",
Gambir,"The room is not bad and clean although it is rather hot (or the AC is working poorly). The mattress is good, but the bed is too short for a tall person like  me (1.90). What I really dislike about this place is the loudness of the music at breakfast. It seems you are attending a disco, rather than having breakfast. Even the music on the corridor to the room is that loud that it irritates you when at your room. What is the point of it? Does the hotel wants it quests to be awake?",
Gambir,"Many times had stayed in this hotel. The location was perfect in the heart of business and government area. The breakfast was so tasty with typically Indonesian traditional foods, though they also served international food. The front desk staffs were so nice and helpful to handle any circumstances of my requests. Perfect for a long or short business stay!",
Gambir,"One of good hotel in pecenongan area for seen, look and find something to eat around Jakarta. The hotel is good, the ambience also good, environment also ok and staff are very friendly is more welcoming you into the Hotel.",
Gambir,"Although the rooms are not spacious, but this hotel is located in the crossroads of the bustle of Central Jakarta, with its culinary appeal around it. A short visit also becomes meaningful with all the facilities available, both by this hotel and the surrounding environment.",

Gambir,"I would like to share my experience staying in Ibis Styles Jakarta Gajah Mada which took place in early December last year. I decided to stay in this hotel since I had an early morning appointment to attend the next day in CBD area of Jakarta.   Since I had stayed in Ibis Jakarta Harmoni the week before, I decided to stay in this particular hotel property. The hotel had confirmed that they would prepare my room for early check-in that day. However, since I had to finish some work prior to checking in the hotel, I arrived in the hotel around noon that day.  Check-in was prompt and efficient.

Gambir,"On the upside, the bedroom given to me was spacious. The air-conditioning system worked perfectly well. The breakfast was excellent with variety of choices (Continental, Javanese, Indonesian). The room service was unbelievably fast and efficient. - On the downside, the hotel lobby on Saturday night was very stressful as there were many wedding guests lounging around. Some of the children were noisy with parents showed no interest in teaching their children better manners in hotel lobby area. It would be good if hotel staff members can remind the noisy people (children and/or adults) to quiet down, and be a little bit more considerate to other hotel guests. Just a thought.",
Gambir,"Located just behind Gaja Madah mall, there is an easy back door access. Room comfortable and large enough. Unfortunately, the toilet leaked on the floor and they couldn't fix it. There were too many mozzies at the lobby and in the restaurant. I had to get some repellent which helped but it was irritating.",

Sawah Besar,"Stayed 3 nights. Basic room but come with free tea and coffee. Location is at a surprisingly quiet area. Good service and a place to stay to get to the airport quickly. 20 mins walk to Mangga Dua Square where there is a Carrefour Transmart Hypermarket located. For some reason, this is the place to shop for Agarwood, some kind of incense wood as there are many shops selling this. Also cheap shopping inside this mall.",

Sawah Besar,"Grand Hyatt should be the grandest of all Hyatt property. In Jakarta, this property is iconic and located above the luxury Plaza Indonesia Mall and facing the Bundaran HI. I really had very high expectation about this hotel.   The lobby is grandeur and huge. Check in was no hassle, I book the night from Traveloka during their flash sale, so I had a very good rate.   The room itself is large and spacious. But it's just not luxurious and seems old. The bathroom is small, but it has bathtub. What disappointed me the most are the bed. I booked twin bed and stay with my friend. But the twin bed configuration is not really twin bed. It's more like double bed split in the middle. There's no space among the 2 beds, literally sticks to each other. The design is not well thought and",
Sawah Besar,"The staff was very helpful, the service was incredible. Very clean room & nice breakfast. Even though i paid for the promo and got late check out till 3PM! the service beyond expectation. Thank you Grand Hyatt!",
Sawah Besar,"If you just want have a simple cozy bed, and crash later at night with no other purpose, this hotel may be a smart decision to stay. Everything is measured by your needs.

Sawah Besar,"Nice hotel, with nice staff  clean room. Great location, valuable rate. Green hotel, due to less plastic consumption.  Overall I love this hotel. Keep it up Red Planet Jakarta Pasar Baru. I will be back!",
Sawah Besar,Two issues with this hotel:  1) air-conditioning doesn't cool the room that much. Are their air-conditioning units properly maintained or are they set to not cool below a certain temperature to save on electricity costs?  2) the cigarette smoke stench inside was the room was quite unbearable. I specifically requested non-smoking but still the room was stinky.,
Sawah Besar,location was ok but only towel and soap were given there was no dental kit. I was disappointed with the choice of breakfast there were no bread all. And they were doing  nothing to offer. So what for the breakfast was included but the fact was nothing. what a bad experience.,
Sawah Besar,"A nice place to have a holiday or for travel business. Good staff and management, clean room, a cozy cafe wich is 2 place for smoking and no smoking area. I think you guys should try this place... By the way it's very cheap but the place is realy good...",

Sawah Besar,"This hotel is nice and near Pasar Baru, but the location is crowded.  Regarding location, since there is shopping mall near hotel, I can buy something necessary if I have time. It is a near from cetral Jakarta.  They have restaurant and roof top. In total is ok and can try to stay here when visit jakarta alone or with couple to stay.  Room is comfortbale.

Sawah Besar,"We stayed in Heef Hotel for one night and everything was good. The lady at the Reception was really helpful and kind.  This hotel is strategically located opposite Passer Baroe, a place to go if you're looking into buying Musical Instruments or just tasting the local food. There's a stretch or market where you can buy things from non-branded slippers, bags, dresses and wigs!  The hotel breakfast was simple but tasted good. They had a choice of local breakfast which is rice, a main dish, some vegetables and keropok. Then, they served Koko Krunch, Bread, Coffee, Tea and Fruits! Good enough.  We're planning to come back again very soon.",

Sawah Besar,"Next please dont put me on 13th floor, because my little girl saw shadow in the room, and she is crying and want to going down. She is scare and finally she is going down with her mother to report to duty manager on the lobby.",
Sawah Besar,"Booked this hotel because from the flash sale of an online travel ecommerce. The protocol was being applied. The security checked our body temperature. The front office staff aren't really friendly, but they were very clear on telling the regulation and hotels details. the old vibes are very strong felt in the elevator, the keycard was'nt for tapped, instead we needed to slide inside the machine. The room is good, very clean, no strange odor. The bathroom is okay, the amenities just okay. At that time, the kids were disappointed because the pool was closed. According to the staff, it was closed due to Covid-19. So we were just spending the time at the room.",

Sawah Besar,"I stayed two nights here with my wife in February 2019. I like the hotel, but the English skills of staff were lacking but with my Bahasa skills we were fine. Plus this is a hotel where locals stay, so you come to expect it. The staff was very friendly. The room was nice with a king sized bed. The bed was a little hard for me, but this is the norm in Indonesia. Other than my wife there was only one other foreigner staying at the hotel, which I do not mind. I would stay here again when passing through Jakarta.",
Sawah Besar,"the room good enough, and service was good . breakfast food tasty i like it . but i don't like the pool next to bar, it was weird while you swim there was people eating and hang out and you can't do cannonball in the pool hahaha .",
Sawah Besar,"We stayed here our last two nights on a 5-week trip.  After a lot of budget hotels with more broken than fixed things it was very comfortable to come here and sleep in spotless linen, with working lights and no furniture broken or damaged.  The swimming pool is also very nice after a hot day of sightseeing. A bit weird though that the pool area is more or less in the restaurant.  Very friendly and helpful staff.   When we stated here, they were renovating on our floor so the hallways had a very bad, chemical smell. But that had no effect in the rooms, you only smelled it when you got out.",
Sawah Besar,"Hotel is recomend for traveller, easy to reach. But if do you want good breakfast, you will dissapointed. Only bread and a cup a coffee only. So you must prepare breakfast youself. But overall is good.",
Sawah Besar,"What can I say..  Front desk, ladies were friendly, Men were not friendly. Houskeeping staffs were hanging out and chit chat loudly while doing their jobs  and I could hear their conversation clearly inside the room. aircon was not cold at all, and hotel gave me room which was so noisy, there was a construction work on the next building, while I have requested quiet room when booking. Lots and lots of mosquitoes everywhere in the lobby, hallway, room. i could not sleep at all. Breakfast is poor. Only one bread with tea/coffee. Nothing else. Location, to pasar pagi 15-25mns walk, to itc 10mns walk. No restaurants nearby  you should go to itc for food. The good things were cleanliness  and a comb in a toilettries bag. Securities were friendly too (although quite busybody asking me",
Sawah Besar,"This hotel is a recommended one if you want to stay at a good hotel with affordable price. It's very near to the ITC Mangga 2, you just need to walk for a few minutes. It is next to a 24 hour store, and there are many local cafes/shops that sell good local food nearby. I really enjoyed staying there.",
Sawah Besar,"this property located very near the mangga dua mall, only 5 minutes walk. However if you want to go to other shopping area like Thamrin, Tanah Abang or Pasar Baru need to take taxi or other type of transportation. It cost around 30,000 - 50,000 RP by taking Blue Bird taxi. Staffs were very polite and respect each guest. Overall hotel was ok except that the Wifi was unavailable for almost 2 days and TV reception was out for 1 day. That really turned us off.",
Sawah Besar,"Clean & tidy room, staff is very helpfull. I will suggest to my friend and family if went to Jakarta. Near with Pasar Pagi mangga 2 Dua and infront hotel have night market. Can shopping there. Overall im satisfied. Good hospitality keep it up 👍🏻",

The location is good for shopping at ITC Mangga dua and having some at Dufan, plus if you want to try the best seafood by the beach too. Checked in with Ms. Putri, which so professional and friendly. The room is very spacious and clean. Talking about the food, we went for breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. Every time we had food and drinks is always delicious. We tried the BEST pempek in Jakarta , and beef pindang, nasi tampan set, cost 88k. It's fantastic for all of us. I cannot how delicious the food was is just incredible in our mouth and tummy. We also went to the spa for a 1-hour massage, mba Alvi and tiffany had a magic hand. Our body was so relaxed and felt refreshed when it finishes. We had",

Sawah Besar,"We booked this hotel for my birthday because every site says it has a pool. First they tried to tell me there is no pool, only a jacuzzi. Then I showed them the photo and they said it is men only. They refused to give me a refund. No we have a hotel for 5 nights that does not allow women to use all the facilities.",
Sawah Besar,"We stayed there in this April for one night. Staff service was excellent, they were really helpful. specially Micheal and Ninik. They have free breakfast buffet with really delicious foods. I highly recommend this place.",
Sawah Besar,"Drinks are reasonable, Heineken beer will cost 125k including tax. Service is good  You get what you pay for It’s a good for one time visit  Ground floor, second floor and fifth floor has club  Second floor service is better. But beware of ladies drink.",
Sawah Besar,"The hotel located in Central Jakarta, near to Food district, i.e. Mangga Besar & Pecenongan.  Wide parking lot, various menu of breakfast, Proactive staff, and Complete nightlife entertainment (club, karaoke, lounge, spa, etc).  When many Travel search engine put this hotel with 4 star, I want to put only 3.5 star, cause some facility in this hotel slighly old. But overall, I want still to visit this hotel in the future.",
Pasar Minggu,"I booked from OTA while they’ve flash sale, only around IDR 500K. Front Desk Agent very nice & really helpful. But, unfortunately the Restaurant, Bar & Pool still close during PSBB. Breakfast was good, with in room dining service and many choices of menu.",
Pasar Minggu,"The first time expected to this hotel was great, all the proses was so well but the badly is nothing to do the phone, television, and internet access doesnt work until the night so mad and bored, the reception said system on down try to fix but 7 hour nothing to fixed at all. I have to down to reception counter to ask something (many times) until the reception give the WhatsApp no for any req. this problem should be have to think and act. This is my first time stay at hotel and get this worst experience.",
Pasar Minggu,"1. It was located on the side of the roadway (one way), because the roadway was split by the toll-road. It was quite far from Shopping Centers, Restaurants, or Tourism places. Luckily, there was De Entrance Arkadia"" which offered several cuisines and could be accessed easily by foot. Or, wait until the ""AEON Southgate"" opens up for the public in the future.  2. The room was nice, clean and spacious. I booked a Deluxe Queen room. It had a small panel inside the room next to the entrance door which had 3 options (“Do not disturb”, “Clean up my room”, and “Please wait”) that we could use to communicate with the hotel’s attendants/outsiders. It was linked to another panel outside the room showing the option we chose from the inside. Mirrors were everywhere, you could find the""",
Pasar Minggu,"1 nights stay experience at Aston Priorty Simatupang was lovely. Highrise building concept offered best city view completely with restaurant, swimming pool also gym. The spacious room with cleanliness detail by amenities. I joined buffet lunch promo and worth it. Breakfast so complete with various of food. Thanks for a hospitality.",
Pasar Minggu,"It has situated in a friendly environment and hub to conduct conferences in the city. Well trained staff and good food. Clean room and good room service, also very good reception staff, make us to come again.",
Pasar Minggu,Find homy accommodation in the heart of South Jakarta. Super nice ambiance and perfect serves from all the staff.  I love all the classic furniture. It feels like to stay at home but with all the hotel facilities. Great stay!!,
Pasar Minggu,"The management upgraded our room to deluxe when superior rooms (our booking) all occupied for. The establishment has a nice and homey feeling to it, like coming to my grandparents' house. The room itself is quite large, but we can see the AC unit was quite old and not as cold as it could be in a very hot day. And for me it's weird when they provide two sets of tea cups, but there's no electric kettle nor tea bags/coffee sachets/sugar, which can only mean those cups for drinking water only?   Overall, I'm staying here paying basic price for basic accommodation and no complaints in that department.",
Pasar Minggu,"I thought that this is a small hotel but actually they have like 40 rooms. The hotel was nice with a vintage interior. The room is not too big but comfy and clean. They have a small pool but I didn't use it.  We love the breakfast, it's Indonesian food and surprisingly good!",
Pasar Minggu,"We first visited this hotel in Okt 2014 and visited it again on 9/10/11May2016 as it is closely located to the area where my wife's parents are living. I have to say that i was pleasantly surprised about the improved breakfast as that was really poor 1,5 year ago. Also the room where the breakfast is served nowadays is really convenient. It's a rather small hotel so don't expect a huge variety but if you're used to Indonesian food you will be perfectly fine. We also tried some diner dishes which perfectly met our expectation and can be considered as very affordable. The staff really tries to do everything in their power to give you a pleasant time and the manager as well as sales manager every now and than, ask if things are as per expectation and they really appreciate and use",
Pasar Minggu,The place is really average. The location is good. Its close to Pejaten Village mall and a massage is just beside.  This location means that you are close to Ampera and Kemang.  The breakfast was really bad.  I stayed at the ground floor. The room wasn't noisy ans bed was a bit hard and I like it that way. The bathroom was always refilled with brush paste.   Staff tries really hard. Service is extent good. I got my shirts pressed for free everyday.,
Pasar Minggu,"A good and proper place for staycation especially for family. Near Ragunan Zoo and Pejaten Village mall, also Kemang and Cilandak area. Some food place and shop around hotel, also near Transjakarta shelter for public transportation user. Really a peaceful place to begin with and there is a small gym and pool for daily activity. Affordable and good impression for the hospitality service. Only the food needs to be improved. Recommended overall.",
Pasar Minggu,"i stayed a night with my family for our holiday.  its not convincing from the street, its looks ordinary small building, but when i got inside theres a nice welcome lobby, the bar and resto had a very good interior design, overall the goods on the hotel have a great taste of interior design, they had modern sanitary and spacious clean room.  the facility quite complete, they had a gym and a pool but the air conditioner in our larger suite room is too small for huge room  so i had a nice experience to stay there",
Pasar Minggu,"This hotel is located strategically as it is close to the Ragunan zoo, and is surrounded by apartments, gas stations, and shopping centers. Completed with a swimming pool, fitness center and meeting rooms made this hotel suit for business. Semi-western interior also comfort for foreigner including the taste of food and room suite.",
Pasar Minggu,The Deluxe Room is very spacious. Menu of Breakfast change everyday. Tasty enough. Strategic location in South Jakarta near Ragunan Zoo and Pusdiklat PLN. There are Busway Stop in front of hotel. Many food stall around it.,
Pasar Minggu,"Stayed here for family trip. Nice little hotel. The staff is very attentive, breakfast was good they served up Fresh Sushi. Very good considering the price. The Suite room we stayed in is huge, the bathroom is marbled and also the coffee shop has high end espresso machine. Will come again",

Pasar Minggu,"We book the hotel due to the convenient distance of a family event. To our shock after 2 hours flying and 2 hours airport transfer by road we ended up in a filthy LOVE BIRD"" short time hotel.. Arriving by 8:00 PM our room was still not available and once we took the time about 30 mins later its smelt of the FRIED RICE and the sheets was stained and smelly. WISH I had the UV light scanner. AC was not working, and the toilet floor was SLIPPERY.  We decided to ABANDON SHIP and move out the room...""",
Pasar Minggu,"really affordable and simple and good location. pure answer to simple needs thats safe, friendly and easy access. would still suggest this to budgeted travellers from outside jakarta and not much of a needy users or guests...",
Pasar Minggu,"Really. I never expected anything this bad. I was simply too exhausted to go home (which takes 3 hours, by the way) so I thought why not find a cheap room where I can crash for the night and get off in the morning for work.  And this cost me almost 20 USD for real. I really am holding back from using the f word.  I can't even call this a hotel. The receptionist was rude af—and that desk didn't qualify as front desk by the way. The exterior seems acceptable, but I regretted spending a dime for the hotel as soon as I stepped into the room. The bed was freaking filthy disgusting. Pretty sure the linens hadn't been washed at least in days, the bathroom never been cleaned in weeks, and everything was just downright disgusting.  I had to turn the lamp off and wear all my clothes on",
Pasar Minggu,"I know I am looking for cheap place to stay but I found some affordable places that better than this one. The bathroom is terrible, no view, fuggy, the tv channel is not clear. Especially it was rainy day.",
Pasar Minggu,"Jakarta is much bigger than Kuala Lumpur a lot as it divides to 5 districts, and it locates at most south end of Jakarta Selatan district with all housing areas. No public buses and trains nearby, only can take by taxi, even go nearest popular spot, Raguan Zoo, also need taxi go there for 30 mins, which is impossible walking around at all. Go to main city centre of Jakarta by taxi also needed at least 2 hours due to extreme super duper heavy traffic jam. At night, nearby hostel has no road lights at all, is very dangerous for all people, especially our family trip with 4 female. Besides that, opposite of the hostel having big construction, so dust and haze flow around until we are not dare open window for whole day. The hostel outlook is showed that no renovation for improvement",

She was very friendly and gave detailed information about the package. regarding the predetermined date is very tight, so I need everything extra fast regarding dealing. she was very patient in handling us who were very concerned about the venue, catering and other operations. On the D-day, everything went well and the bride and groom and their family were very happy with the event. all the staff there are very friendly, even though at that time the hotel has not officially opened.

Near many good restaurants and a shopping center, easy to find anything you need. The room is very spacious, clean, well-decor and comfortable. The breakfast could be better, because there was too few options and quite bland. The staffs were very helpful though. Overall, definitely will stay here again someday!",

So I don't know whether the promotion photo room is exist or not. The good point is the reception is very nice. And you have to leave your ID card in the receptionist. Please remember that you have to turn off your air-con if you want to turn on water boiler or the electricity will drop. LOL",

I had to remind the receptionist on numerous request I have already previously made through their whatsapp. Their internal communication is so poor that those requests had to be reminded? I sign up for their club benefits which include in-room check in which I specifically said that would be my preference. But check in was still done at lobby.   The room was disappointing to say the least. The service, the amenities were basic or non-existent. There was no stationery, no bath salts, no tea mugs, no glasses, one tube of lotion sat on top of the sink. They have also downgraded their tea from TWG to dilmah.

It was also next to Kemang which offers many restaurants, bars, and nightlives. Unfortunately, it wasn’t accessible by public transportation, alternatively you might choose Taxis or other online transportations.  2. The room wasn’t so spacious, yet so compact. I booked a Deluxe King Room. The atmosphere was filled with Japanese vibes. It was also clean and fresh. The interior was dominated with young-woods on the bedstead, work desk, cabinets, TV backdrop, and paint backdrop, completed with a pale brown parquet on the floor.

So I quickly booked the room.   Upon my arrival, guest what? They said my room was not available because there were already guests in the room. Yes, the guests were in the room which I had booked.

Everything else was pretty standard, nothing that you couldn't find in other hotels. Wifi quality was just okay. But the hot water in the shower or the tap turned out to be not hot enough, so that's a minus. The room came with breakfast option but I check-out so early, before 6 am, so I didn't have the chance to taste the meal.

One of the front-officer told me that my CC was invalid (how come? I showed him that the expired date is 2022 :(). This situation was very unpleasant. We were exhausted after a long journey from Bandung which took 7 hours due to odd-even plate number route), the kids needed rest and already had tantrums. I decided to pay using my debit card, and they finally gave us our rooms (8 twin-beds rooms on the 6th floor and 2 double-bed rooms on the 3rd floor).  The rooms, although they were old and shabby, were clean and smelled nice, alhamdulillah. The single beds were comfortable, the sheets were clean. Owh I almost forgot, there was a small trouble,",
Mampang Prapatan,"When on transit in Jakarta I spent one night in this hotel and I was really disappointed. The only positive thing was the price, about $ 40 incl. a very limited brekfast.The check in was not done in professionell way, no info about wifi, also they did not tell me how I can watch the soccer match at night (it was possible after stick in a card in the tv set). No support with the luggage by security, they just watch when u carry the luggage, also when I checked out. Overall it is not clean, even the hotel is not that old. Also staff at bfast not motivated and very limited choice of food, poor presented. They rip you off when you are picked up or dropped as the drivers have to pay Rp 5.000 when leaving the location, this is absolutely very bad way of looking for money from",

Mampang Prapatan,"For a budget hotel that we hope is to be able to rest well so that the next day we can be fresh and do our activities. In this hotel the room is clean and comfortable, I can rest well, can have breakfast too, there is one thing that I suggest if you may have a brighter bathroom light, because the bathroom is for cleaning the body, shaving and others.  Coincidentally after checking out and have been somewhere else, my wife's wallet was left behind and we contacted the hotel to look in our room, and it turned out to be completely left behind. thank you for help, honesty and cooperation so that the wallet can be back in good condition and safe  thank you the staff are kind and friendly.",

Fyi,  we didn't request anything and were already about to sleep by then.   He ask if i can open the door,  but i refuse since i worry about our safety. He hanged around a minute or so while looking at his phone before leaving. I called the reception immediately but he brushed off that they have cctv so nothing is to worry about.    However,  upon meeting another receptionist, she showed a bit of concern and assure us that any guest visitor will have to go through a thorough check before allowed to go up,  with their staff as escort.  Worth noting that all access to the hotel room is via their hotel card so it was rather weird how""",

During this pandemic situation, hope Harris also more strict to people who wanted to visit the guest. Prescreening point in the front of the door needs to be lift up by putting also disinfectant for the shoes  For food quality, I was disappointed.

Love the swimming pool design and the clean of swimming pool and other areas. But, we see a minus when in our bedroom we couldn't find a tissue (while in toilet there's so many tissue). We can move tissue from toilet to our bedroom. And also for hot water, it took very long time to become hot. We already complained to operator and they said it was because they turn off the hot water machine in specific times. WE know all the hotel did it's part of save energy and protect the world. So, we suggest for tissue in toilet you can move one tissue to bedroom and for hot water, you can turn on the",
Tebet,"I remember booking the hotel on Traveloka flash sale. The rate was almost half from the normal rate. It was such a good deal! Arrived at the hotel, the protocol was applied. Started by checking the temperature and providing the hand sanitizers. When I checked in, the receptionist was not that friendly yet so helpful. When I asked for room at the high floor, she said that currently there were only 2 floors opened.  I said ok and requested the street view.  The room was very clean, neat, with good smell. Overall, I give 8.5 for the room, and also they gave me the street view so I could enjoy the view and enjoying sunset. The swimming pool was fine too. They provided towels, and when my nephew swam, there was only 3 people inside the pool (including my nephew) I was so happy",

My first impression was fast check in process then as I entered the room I found it spacious and clean.  All rooms there are non smoking. But there were some smoking area in Kenanga restaurant and Anggrek restaurant. I like spending time in Anggrek restaurant enjoying good food and live music. My favorite was nasi kapau dendeng balado, it was like Padang cuisine. I loved the taste and presentation. My favorite drinks there were black coffee of course and chocolate ginger.  A friend of mine told me that the pindang patin and salmon steak were great. But unfortunately I don't like fish. Wanted to have a bite though some time.  The breakfast in Kenanga",
Tebet,"For me, Grand Bidakara Pancoran has good location, not too far from office center in Kuningan. Few days ago, I brought my wife and children there, and it was okay. The swimming pool and playground is good, although it was not big. I love breakfast menu in this hotel, suitable for Indonesian food fans. Unfortunately, the room size is quite small, it need to be more developed. But overall, this hotel can be your choice for traveling in Jakarta with standard price.",

The hotel itself is a big hotel but look like very old. we think that this hotel need to be renovated to make more attractive. we believe if this hotel has been renovated, it will very interest to stay at this hotel.  For the food, good enough. Many kind of food serve during breakfast.  So the improvement which is needed by this hotel is only renovation",
Tebet,"I picked this hotel to attend someone’s wedding.  This is an old hotel, with quite well maintained building.  Staff friendliness are so so in their hospitality, most probably due to the high occupancy.  Spacious room with so so cleanliness also. They need to see the underbed cleanliness. I pushed the bed since we couldnt get queen size bed and shoched to find it so dirty.  Met couple of guess in the lift whose being handle by the Duty Manager I assumed. They told us to be careful coz somebody enter their room.  7.30am in the Morning while still sleeping. Someone knocking at the door.

Tebet,I stayed there for two nights in September. When I got there a security officer ask me to wash my hands in a wash basin provided beside the building. I also saw disinfecting chamber there. Then a front office staff help me with check in process. He wore face mask and face shield. Staffs in the restaurant wore the same PPE. The breakfast was also delivered to my room instead of having buffet like before pandemic. The breakfast were two choices either Asian or western. Due to the limited guests they had there was only one building opened which is non smoking one. I appreciate their effort to serve guests with all limitations due to pandemic.,
Tebet,I love this hotel which located in Patra Kuningan which is a business area but surrounded by green area. Staying here did not feel like in the heart of Jakarta. I saw some improvement in service and products they had.  Let's start from my fast check in process assisted by Risca and Imam. It was and also they mention a bit about their hotel. Then I entered my room which was a lot cleaner than my room last year. Around midnight when suddenly I was starved I order room service and accepted by Mayang. Then my order was delivered by Imron as I recalled. An oxtail tom yum came less then 30 minutes. The taste was great. I had it twice actually with another one for my lunch. In the morning I had breakfast and helped by Steffany. She asked my what I wanted for breakfast and served me.,

Unfortunately the canal opposite the hotel has become a smelly ditch and there are no pavements so there is nowhere to walk near the hotel. You need a taxi. Hotel check in staff are not efficient, you can help by having all the right documents on hand and being patient. My room had a problem with the phone lead so the phone didn't work during my stay. You need to phone down to ask for a hairdryer and this took 20 mins and 2 phone calls to procure. There is no soap dish. The disinfected glasses in the bathroom looked dirty. But the bed was clean and comfortable and the curtains blocked out the light and there are a lot of TV channels for foreigners. I would stay again, if forced to.",

Since my husband & our kids can’t eat spicy food, I intended to ordered an omelette or else from the egg station for them to eat.. Turned out the egg station are not open before 7 AM so my husband and our kids only eat porridge and sliced fruits.. It’s get better at the second day though, so it’s still an OK..

Tebet,"I stayed here for a business trip because it was close to all of the places I needed to go in Jakarta. On the good side it was within walking distance to a trans Jakarta stop so it was bearable to go places and brave the traffic but the hotel itself was not well kept. My room was damp, the linens smelled that I took my pillow casings off one night so that I can sleep, and the breakfast horrible. The staff was, however, quite nice and helpful. Really, that is the only highlight of this hotel.",

Tebet,"My friend lived in Puri Casablanca 20 odd years back when he was working as an ex pat, and it was good and all shiny. Now it’s like an ex rental after 20 plus years. It all works though fortunately, but no wonder there are few internal shots. Facilities are numerous. Running, tennis, mini golf, putting, sauna, spa, etc. Our apartment serves us well but fridge was broken and kitchen was certainly 25 years old and weathered badly. So too the bathroom and shower room. It was also interesting to have views over a cemetery! Very convenient for Kokas with loads of food and quite a big mall. Breakfast was included. Small but adequate range.",
Tebet,"Went to Jakarta with a group of 9 friends for 3 nights and stayed at 3 apartments ( 3 bedroom)  @Puri Casablanca.  While the location is great with just 200m walk to nice shopping mall in Kota Kasablanca where you get a lot of branded shops and a variety of food outlets to grab a bite.  The facilities are excellent at the Puri with decent gym, great pool, tennis courts and kids play area and a more than decent super market to buy everything you need while staying in an apartment.  The only flip side is the service levels of be it front office, house keeping or maintenance ( attending to your need) Either they have too many booking and cannot cope up or simply short of staff.   But despite that everything else is excellent and it’s huge apartment complex.   I sincerely Hope they",

We highly appreciate for they arrangement, because they prepared good decoration for our wedding anniversary, and we really love the decoration and its cake.   However, we bit dissapointed with Breakfast in this hotel. They provided so ordinary choice of the breakfast. It didn’t represent breakfast of Five Star / Prestigious Hotel in Jakarta. Very limited option. I realize that i stay in this hotel with promotional rates, but i didn’t expect the service on their breakfast is dissapointed.   Previously, during pandemic, i also stayed in another hotel in Bandung. Let compare it with Trans Luxury Hotel Bandung. I didn’t know, if it’s comparable / peer to peer hotel or not, but in my opinion",
Petamburan,"We stayed only for one night but the service was outstanding, we were able to have a late check-out without paying extra. The hotel has direct access to the mall. Rooms are clean and nice. I was underestimate with this hotel but actually it was beyond my expectations. Definitely will come back for another stay. My room was upgraded by mr oke at front desk he was really nice once again thank you",
Petamburan,"On last week end on Nov'20, I check in a standard room at Ciputra, with price around 600k at that time. I got excellent services the front desk informed me that my room was upgraded to an executive room in 1625, the second highest level at the hotel. During pandemic, the room is sealed once already sanitized. And once entering the room, every thing is clean and tidy. With all compliments inside like Dilmah tea, Nescafe, mineral water that can be ask any time and free of charged.   The foodies that can be delivered to the swimming pool at pulau bar & V posture gym/sauna are my favorite things to enjoy. I recommend to try some menu like Nasi goreng, Rawon, Mushroom cream soup 🍲. All the menus are very affordable for a four star hotel 🏨 at the center of Jakarta capital.. For sure",

Petamburan,"in this pandemic choosing best accomodation for staycation is 1 of my concern. But when i came in this hotel for staycation with my baby i feel save and comfy^^  Great service, Humble staff, Safety measure when cek in, sanitize room service, Breakfast in room service, good wifi, AC was cold fast, hot water, comfy bed and free parking ^^  i feel safety and comfy with all of that service ^^ thank you see you next staycation ^^",
Petamburan,"This is my first stay here during pandemic. I can understand that they make some adjustments like in the breakfast and some other services. Some facilities were geting more limited but their effort to continously provide the best services is apreciated.  The room was still clean and well arranged. The food were also great although there was no buffet but their fast service especially in the breakfast time did not let me down.  Some staffs like Marisha and Ricardo were quick and caring. They also sanitize the table and chair first. Beside the room which were profesionally arranged by Ari, Lidya and Pamela, Bunk was always my favorite. I always love the coffee. Endang and Ikbal were also caring  and also ask if I need anything else. Thanks for take away coffe to accompany me",
Petamburan,"Impressions of the room, great, it has a different layout and that makes the room feels  spacier and modern. Great sanitation, the All Safe standard is high and it feels clean and safe, hand sanitizers at every elevator, inside and outside of it. Waiter brings you hand sanitizer after contact.   My biggest concern is the food, it makes no effort whatsoever to even compete with the surroundings eating places at Central Park. It's a sub par food, came cold, and the meat was dry. The exorbitant price of 160.000++ for a meek of 8 pieces of satay is ridiculous. It's even more expensive compared to the sister hotel a Five Star, Pullman Vimala Hills Ciawi, at a much much lower quality of food.   Second concern is the in room TV, small and very old. The pictures are grainy too. It makes",

The breakfast by the pool was extremely fantastic, you can enjoy the view from there! However, more variety on breakfast will be a good point to be added. Unfortunately I had no chance to enjoy their gym and pool. Overall, it was a perfect stay and wonderful experience. Definitely will be back soon!",

Petamburan,"I chose Harris because of its location. And I do believe that I could stay, wfh and rest peacefully. Unfortunately the other guests didn't respect it. Most of the time, the other guests next door can't keep their voice low and even laughing in the corridor. For the staff, when the guest put don't disturb"" tag, means that: please don't even make any noice in front of the room, beside not knocking on the door.   During this pandemic situation, hope Harris also more strict to people who wanted to visit the guest. Prescreening point in the front of the door needs to be lift up by putting also disinfectant for the shoes  For food quality, I was disappointed. For someone who needs to stay still in the room, and no choices to order from outside, you must be very patient till your end""",

Because I wanted to secretly surprise him, I contacted the FO, her name was Ms. Nurul. She really helped me in coordinating the plan to give this surprise. This includes allowing me to send gifts and birthday cakes using a courier service before we check in. The team was very helpful and friendly. Even the room was helped with decoration and gifts and cakes were immediately placed in the room as my request.  Upon check in, we were also given an upgrade to the Grand Deluxe Room. Our room was very spacious, clean, the bathroom was very comfortable and the room view was extraordinary (our room faced GBK, so both day and night the view of GBK was very",

Petamburan,Stayed in the Grand Deluxe Room for a night. The service was top notch. Love love love the bathroom and the view from the room. Headed to Sultan Pizzeria for dinner by the pool (must try!) and had delicious seafood marinara pizza and the tastiest linguine carbonara ever.  Also had a pleasant morning walk around the hotel and generous portion of breakfast! Definitely will comeback :),
Petamburan,"I stayed for a night but it was definitely a breath of fresh air. The room was cozy, the food served were delicious, and the staff were warm-hearted and helpful. I especially loved spending my day and night at the pool - a picturesque green oasis literally in the middle of tall skyscrapers without hearing any traffic noises. All in all, my first staycation experience amidst the coronavirus pandemic was absolutely splendid!",

Petamburan,"The location of this hotel is in one of the busy road in West Jakarta. During pandemi, they only open for one floor and smoking room. But the room not too smelly. The room not so big, but the interior is good enough and clean. They closed all the public facilities such as bar, gym, and swimming pool. The lobby looked like an empty hotel, they turn off the aircon at the lobby and and need morr lighting (too dark). The carpet in the room is so old and not clean enough.",
Petamburan,"I stayed there for new year. They had this new year pajamas party"" package so we took it. The room was nice, we asked for high floor and they provided that. It has a really big window giving us a really nice view on the city. The food in that party was so nice too! My favorite was the beef wellington. However, that night was raining so heavily (it was the the night before Jakarta had a really terrible flood). And in the morning, we realize that our room was dripping wet. There was a leak on the ceiling. We complained about it when we had breakfast, but it seems like even after the breakfast, that situation hasn't been handled and now the floor is even wetter.  Check out was a chaos too. The elevator didn't work so we had to use the stair (and remember I told you that we have a""",

Petamburan,"I have stayed in this hotel for more than 20 times.  Overall things are ok, and breakfasts are always exceptional  A big no-no about rooms with  the number of ×08, ×10, ×12 of every floors as they are very noisy from the AC blower.  Feel the sensation of sleeping next to a running powerful generator.  The humming noise is very loud and unbearable. In fact it is 03:02AM now and I still wide awake from the noise.  Was in room 908, complained, moved to 912.  No difference!",
Petamburan,"Breakfast and lunch is so good, the location is strategic with superindo next to the hotel you can find anything you need.

I will definitely share with my friends to stay in your hotel if they were to visit / work related .",
Petamburan,"I just visited this night to meet my friend who stayed in this hotel. Honestly, I not stayed yet however I have bad experience with their staff especially the security guards. I don’t know what happen there or the sop for them but I think what happened to me as their guest were rude. My friend and I were came to the hotel with a car and driver, from the beginning the security guard give us a kinda rude attitude, without any clear instruction to enter the main gate and do the security check. We still ok with that. Then, we have to wait about one hour and half at the lobby. And for the first time, I felt so annoyed with the security guard. He was walked around us and looked curious and annoyed with us. As my experiences, we can meet someone at the lobby, right? Even we can talk",
Petamburan,"Located at Central Jakarta, Lumire is a perfect location to those who have a working purpose around this area : meeting a collegue, attending a seminar, or even a short getaway. As I believe, a new inspiration sometimes comes from a a right place at a right time. . The room itself is 37sqm sized, completed with a kingsize bed, a working desk and a bathtub. If you ask me what is my favourite? Nothing else than the view of the iconic National Monument from my room window and an easily accessible shopping mall by walking. Love it!",

Petamburan,"This hotel actually not even old, it was only opened in 2013, but I felt like I’m staying in very old hotel. Not cheap either, around £15-£20 a night. From the outside the building looks alright but the inside was kind of disappointing. The bathroom was unbelievable, it looked like it never been deep cleaned for ages! The shower worked funny and obvious never been taken care of, the drains weren’t really work and make it flooded, the same with the sink drain as well. The TV was very small like a computer screen but it wasn’t a big deal. Bed linens are washed but yellowish and worn out, the same with the towels.  The worst part was, I called the receptionist to clean my room but it never came.  Dear Amaris, please take a annual maintenance for your business. It could be better.",

Petamburan,"Staycation here with fams. A bit crowded for the visitors. Front desk a bit slow as only 2 staffs handled so many visitors. Overall it is a clean hotel. It more likely Apartment. I take Bussiness room. Got a kitchen, living room, bedroom, walk in closet and bath room (using bathup). Staff kind and helpfull. The plus point for me is the swimming pool area. For a little kids can play in the sand pool without worrying get drown. Food and beverages taste good. But it is a bit shame when breakfast time in resto, the staff is not fast response to re-stock the food / cutlery. There also a taxi pool for pax who don't bring vehicles.",
Petamburan,"The best place for staycation in Jakarta area.   Kids love the giant pool and the sandy man-made beach.  Strategic location near the mall. Fast wifi.  Dusty floors when we first check in. Dim lighting, old furniture. The breakfast crew service and the food taste need to be improved.   Many food stalls were emptied during bfast time. The refill time took so long. The spring bed was not so comfortable, and the pillows were so big but hard, useless. Lucky we brought additional pillows from home, otherwise we couldn't sleep well during our stay.  Anyways, compare to its spacious room size and the price, it's so value for money.",
Petamburan,"I stayed for 1 night only, with my parents. The room was a bit old (room no : 703) but clean. Shower at the bathroom has a problem. During breakfast,  some of the menu was empty and took so long for the staff to refill.  The most disappointing part was the receptionist never inform us, if we bring a car, we need to get a stamp from the receptionist, so it will be free during check out. I found this problem, when I was in front of the check out gate, and the security guard inform me,I need to pay IDR 40,000 for the parking fee, but If I were a guest hotel, I can make it free if I had a hotel stamp on my parking ticket. Too bad that I received this important info at the very late time and circumstances. It is not possible for me to move backwards, due to so many cars behind me. I",

Petamburan,"Very spacious hotel room, it’s more likely a furnished apartment only the furniture looked a bit worn out, need to be renovated. However, when I booked for non-smoking room, but everytime we enter the room, I sensed smokey air inside. Perhaps the previous guest smoked there.  Cool AC in 1 room but not cool AC in living room and the other room, but after telling the housekeeping about the problem, the engineer fixed the master bedroom AC and it was so cool. Thank God for that so we had decent sleep, apart of the too bouncy spring bed (I’d personally prefer the harder ones).  Basically we love the pools and the room, also its strategic location (in walking distance to Citraland mall). However, the breakfast time was below expectancy. It took very long time in egg station and get",

Petamburan,"I've stayed here several times because the location suits me fine. This time, however, I have some negative reviews. Even though I made a booking, the reception only gave me a room at 4:00pm. Totally unacceptable. And this time the room was not as clean as before. Complacency has set in. Management should act.",

Petamburan,"Stayed for 1 night (29 sept - 30 sept) cause air conditioner in our house is under maintenance and have a lil baby, so we decided to stay in Maple Hotel.  When i checked in to the room, FO was told me about the bed from twin bed to be 1 bed. I dont have a problem about the bed, but made terrible cause bed cover doesnt cover the bottom side. Comfortable for family or couple trip, over all this is the good one hotel on budget with nice place on the riverside. I appreciated for the restaurant, very urbanish style like placed myself had a breakfast in Europe 😘 Thank u Maple!",
Petamburan,"Overall the hotel looked the same as the photos and other reviews. The check-in/out process goes pretty quick. The room was lovely and for the toiletries, there's only a toothbrush without toothpaste, no sandal. The toilet didn't have a nice or bad smell, but the toilet wall is dusty seems haven't been cleaned up and the towel was really bad. The bed has a stain and there are only 10 channels on the tv. There are two elevators but the other one was in maintenance. The dining area was lovely but I don't really like food.",
Petamburan,"The hotel was not as clean as we saw in the pics. The staff failed to respond our room service requests. Plus, the hotel area was not a friendly place where we witnessed some prostitution. Not a place to stay for a foreigner, especially for a family.",
Petamburan,"I stayed with them and it is satisfying, Andy at reception was very helpful, room is clean and has great view , Khoiri is very friendly and helpful and also Mita who offered us some eggs and toast, breakfast is very Indonesian, enough for budget hotel like this, price is very affordable, reccomended for budget stay around Grogol",
Petamburan,"Having had bad experience elsewhere, booked only 1 night to see. Empty lobby with staff hiding in the corners. Room with no windows, old and worn out. Shower hardly any water coming out. Provided WIFI password does not work. AC not cold at all. At 8:00am someone knocking on the door non stop, In incomprehensible English he advises me he is housekeeping to make the room., Insane? why on earth would you go knocking on guests door at 8 am asking to make the room and why would you continue knocking if guest does not open the door?",
Petamburan,"A somewhat rundown hotel much in need of renovation and refurnishing, only one of the two lifts were functioning. the location is less than attractive next to a major bus station, noisy and at night somewhat sinister. Breakfast a disaster, instant coffee and mediocre Indonesian food only.",
Petamburan,"The hotel is located in a very scruffy part of town but fortunately right next door to the Blok M bus station so transport links are excellent. It is in South Jakarta so it's over an hour to North Jakarta. The hotel itself is pretty good but slightly faded. The room was nice and big and very brightly lit. Noisy, being next to the bus station and a mosque with regular calls to prayer. The breakfast was excellent with numerous choices from a variety of cuisines. Staff were really helpful.",
Petamburan,"I stayed two nights for business trip at this hotel and had a twin-bed room at 6th fl. First image that I received from this hotel when I arrived was: O-o not my type"". It is an old hotel and not maintain adequately. The carpet on meeting room at 2nd floor was very dirty and urgently need to be replaced. The WiFi on the meeting room was unstable, and I prefer to used my own MiFi. The partition between meeting room was not soundproof, so we could hear what other presenter saying on the next meeting room. That's annoying.  The bed room was quite spacious (about 24-26 m square), and fortunately without carpet and have a very bright lighting system and convenient for working with laptop at night. The desk itself not wide enough for a laptop, so I prefer to open the laptop on bed).""",

Penjaringan,"We used the Mercure PIK as a transit hotel between our domestic flights and we were absolutely blown away! We loved how close it is to the airport, about 20 minutes, we just paid for a Golden bird taxi from the airport and booked the return through the hotel.   We had 2 rooms next to each other one for my family and the other for my parents. The rooms were very clean and modern, with everything you'll ever need, we found the beds comfortable. There is security at the door and they screen all bags, my father had knives in his bag (to cut his fruit lol) and they were taken off him.  On the return we had to depart a day earlier, leaving us with a day stay instead of an overnight. I explained this to the fabulous staff member Ms Ninik and she very kindly upgraded our room, the view",

Penjaringan,"The room was good, clean, and tidy good for stay in pandemic situation, staff was helpfull and friendly, start from security and checkin with ms ai sapitri .. breakfast also good .. location near with mall emopium and pluit juntion",
Penjaringan,"So each room is designated with letters. And the K room is directly facing a tall building next door. so it s just like having a room with no windows. and the receptionist won't accept a room change. i guess it s saved for the VIPs. just great...  so as good as the interior is, i can't give this more than 2 stars. sorry. I believe other room will have much better luck and views..",
Penjaringan,"Rooms are exactly as advertised, bright, clean and spacey. Although it is an serviced apartment, the cleanliness of the units are those of hotels. The quality of the furnitures are great comfy beds, comfy dining chairs and couch. The kitchen are adequate for general basic cookings with good utensils provided, enough for the number of people staying.   Outdoor area are excellent, big seating area with indoor and outdoor pool. But I want to note that access are limited due to distancing, I would recommend you to ask for details regarding this facility.   Two minimarkets, one at each end of the buildings.",
Penjaringan,"If you intended to have a leisure swimming staycation with your friends or loved ones - mind that the magnificent pool area only accessible with 1 access card = 1 person policy. Thus, if you stay in Studio Room you got 2 access cards , but if you stay in 2BR Apartment you only got 3 cards, and 3BR Apt only got 4 cards. Children can get in without separate access card from adult, so for 5yo and under its no prob but if you go with your fam/friend please consider what I mentioned above about the rule - since it's a bit unfair and absurd, or consider booking many studio rooms instead of 1 bigger apartment so you can get enough access card to the pool for everyone - Or just get in like you don't care since I saw many other guests did this LOL. (Not sure this is Covid19 situation",
Penjaringan,"Newly opened serviced apartment in a strategic location. Very complete apartment amenities and staff is extremely accommodating and responsive to my needs. Nadia is especially helpful, friendly and very attentive to her guests, making my stay a very pleasant one. Thank you for your kind and stellar service, Nadia!",
Penjaringan,Had a nice stay here. The room is relatively new and very cozy. Perfect place to unwind with great view. Nadia was very helpful during the leasing process. Very nice environment too. Evrything you need is here. Very recommended!,
Penjaringan,+: Spacious room. Overall cleanliness. Clean and modern room design. Good location. No frills. All amenities working perfectly. Good value at the time of our stay. Good for business trip. Good soundproofing.  -: Lobby is a bit obscure. Quite a long way to the reception without any clear signage. Staff (particularly at reception) can be more courteous. Reception area and hallway leading to it are quite dark.,
Penjaringan,"The first time when I arrived at this hotel when the Psbb transition was in Jakarta, I saw that the checking standards of the hotel were still very lacking.  Entering the small lobby, two receptionists were ready to serve me.  given a room on the 3rd floor and my first impression of the room was spacious, this was beyond my expectations when I saw the photo from the website ihg.  Although in my opinion the lighting in the room is still very lacking, but for the design and aesthetics is good enough for the price and class of this hotel.  The hotel also provides free pgi meals but there is no buffee because the PSSB period is still ongoing.  My second note is that there are so many items that are damaged or do not function properly in the room such as broken TV stands, broken",
Penjaringan,This property is located adjacent to a very large new shopping mall and reasonably convenient to the CGK airport. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. One of the low points to this HI Express was the breakfast buffet. It was sparse and the coffee maker was u/s. Not enought staff and those that were there seemed to lack direction and skill. The hotel serves large Chinese tourist groups whom generally lack any manners or courtesy. No hostess seating so it was a free-for-all. Would not go back to this property,
Penjaringan,"Everything was good !! Glad to be back here.. the room is clean, connecting with the mall also, Special thanks to Nella at Front desk and Elfa at restaurant for the good service during stay, keep it up :)",
Penjaringan,"Great customer service and excellent location and that was as far as good things I could say about this hotel  Dirty bathroom , dirty carpets dirty walls bedsheets was not even properly fit into the bed ( too small) Breakfast was allright not much option Room 420.

Penjaringan,"It was my first time in Indonesia and Hariston Hotel & Suites never disappoint me. The service was great, all my request was all paid attention by the staffs just in time. The room was all equipped properly, wifi was great, it worked very well. Breakfast has many selection. Also, hotel's location was also convenient. Near airport, shopping malls, and attractions. There was a convenient store called Alfamart just next to the hotel. Overall, our stay was great and will definitely come back again on my next visit to Jakarta. This is probably my 2nd home here in Jakarta. Many thanks to the friendly, front desk staffs - Sarah & Chandra , they made sure that i had a great stay with them. Thank you Hariston Hotel & Suites and i will be back very soon!",
Penjaringan,"It was a good experience overall here. The front office staffs surprised me to greet us by name by the second day of our stays & afterwards, the welcome drink was nice, the room is quite specious, we can see sunset from our room and it is clean. They can improve on the breakfast menus since we stayed for 4 nights there and would be nice to have different kind of menus. The hotel is very close to many restaurants and street food stalls, so if you want to try local Indonesian/ Chinese food, it will be a good choice to stay here. We like the pool side, nice and clean.",
Penjaringan,"Best hotel in Pluit Area.. We're very satisfied with Favehotel Pluit Junction especially service and hospitality..  Special Thanks for Ibu Fidel, Ibu Grace and Pak Martin for their great help during our stay !! We definitely will stay here again in the future",

Penjaringan,Came back to stay in this hotel many times. As usual received excellent 5* customer service from both Ms Agnes and Mr Huda. Both are friendly with good attitudes and going the extra mile to help guests. Ms agnes personally informed me about my incoming parcel and kept it for me. Thank you for your help.   Something for the hotel management to take note for these 2 excellent staff. Thanks  The airport pickup and drop off shuttle can be improved in giving more time slots.,
Penjaringan,"The hotel is not big it would count amongst the smallest hotel I know but I think it has a good location to reach north, central and western Jakarta area it also has easy access to the airport via toll. It is also within very close distance to tons of food and cafe.  I would recommend getting the delux room though, nothing lower than that, comparable to a normal hotel rooms, with window facing outward. Clean, functional, comfortable bed, acceptable lighting, sufficiently spacious bathroom and very clean. It doesn’t have a work space, but the table by the TV would be sufficient to do light work. The staff is quite remarkable, very helpful and polite. The breakfast is predominantly all Indonesian food delicious and fresh with options of soup and deserts. There are convenient",
Penjaringan,the hotel actually not expensive. but the room you get is small. the windows will see the lobby so you need keep the curtain closed all the time. they serve simply normal breakfast which no special food. but overall breakfast already good,
Penjaringan,"Hotel is too small, room is basic (as a budget hotel standard). The good things is its location, close to supermarket and easy to find food around. Since the hotel located exactly in front of the hospital, so more convenient for those people from other cities/towns which are having something to do in the hospital. Breakfast is so so, nothing special. From my deluxe room, I still able to hear laud people voices and luggage dragging, in the morning and evening time. In term of room cleaness is not bad.",
Penjaringan,"Its my 2nd visit in this hotel. The room is small but thankfully the sheet is clean..the towel a little yellow though 😅  They provides soap,thoothbrush and hair dryer which is a good thing..and coffee tea also.  The pillow quite fluffy  But when there are people walking through the corridor you can hear them..dragging the luggage..the neighbor next door phone ringing or water running (while they showering) is hear-able  There is supermarket downstairs and some cafe and eatery",
Penjaringan,"We get in this hotel for 2 days, and the first impression was the one you can see in the pictures. The bed was as if it is never cleaned, same is the bathroom and what make it worst that once we asked for assistance they send new bed cover with the security and asked me to change it my self. Next day there was no water for more than 2 hours , and to add on this the rooms are very small with no view at all ( once you open the window you see the building iron cover blocking the view.   Asking for assistance there is something useless cus you will never get it.",
Penjaringan,Booked a room here and when I arrived it took about 30 minutes for the staff to find my booking. It's located near Emporium Pluit. The room was clean and nice. The bed was also comfortable. They didn't have electric kettle in the room but they provided 2 water bottles. They also had a spacious parking space.,
Penjaringan,as usual smaris hotel small room and clean but this time is not good at all.. the bed sheet is like to old.. the color change to white bone.. not look clean enough.. breakfast as usual. so so.. the location is good,

I know this is a budget hotel but.. seriously? no wardrobe, almost no hanger for shirt.. well okay not a big deal..   So. what is the main concern so that I give terrible"" score for this hotel  1. AC is warm, I call the front desk and they said it's normal. I don't complain much since I need to go to the funeral, and when I came back, yes.. the AC is really warm, so I request changing room  They said all rooms were occupied. I insist to get what I should get since I already PAID before I arrived at that hotel. Later they offer me another room (305), I quickly check the aircon.. it seems fine but.. whats that with MESSY AND DIRTY room and bathroom? So.. I""",
Penjaringan,"I stay at this hotel for 1 night. Located in the pluit area, near the heaven funeral. The Emporium Mall can be reached by a 10-minute walk, or 2 minutes by car. Room size is quite spacious for the size of a 2 star hotel. The room rates are pretty cheap compared to other 2 star hotels in the pluit area. Spacious parking lot. On Sundays there is a church in the first floor meeting room. The breakfast is quite okay although the menu selection is not too much. Overall I am quite satisfied with this hotel, the facilities are in accordance with the price i paid.",
Penjaringan,"I cant feel the aircond, it's so slow that I sweat while sleeping. Also there's no kettle. That's very inconvenient. The service is friendly, the room is clean. The location is also okay. Nothing to shout about.",

Penjaringan,"Hotel à proximité de l'aeroport, idéal pour une escale d'une nuit. L'entrée de l'hotel est difficile à trouver. Les chambres et la salle de bain sont grandes et très calme. A priori c'est une très bonne surprise pour le prix...jusqu'au moment où moment où on se met au lit. Les 2 lits de notre chambre étaient contaminés par les puces.",

When I made the booking, I was so surprised to see the rate, it was cheap, so I straight away confirmed the booking and made the payment. Soon enough I received a confirmation email about my booking in this hotel. I arrived at 02:05 PM, only to receive news that my room wasn't available yet, and the receptionist asked me to wait for 10 minutes. After nearly 30 minutes and seemed like no further news, I came back to the reception desk and asked about my room, and the receptionist told me she gave me the only available room, which is on the 2nd floor. Came to the room, first problem that hit me was",
Penjaringan,"The people at the front desk are very friendly, but to book a room, you have to do this with some app. (They will assist you with it, I cannot recall the app since I never used it before, but booking a room needs to be done with their app).  Then you have a really clean room, perfect noise-insulation against the noisy Jakarta streets, everything is perfect.  But when you order food/drinks in the restaurant, they don't know the practice of putting the bill on your room.  The restaurant will start stalking you on the phone around 11-12PM at midnight.  And don't even mind eating there, 1/10th of the food on the menu is not available, the other is waiting to give you diarrhoea.  So the wake-up calls for paying for food that made you sick is the last you want.",
Penjaringan,"I liked the hospitality of the staff, the room provided is also nice and clean. for the price that i paid, i got the best possible return for my money. There were also many food options around this hotel. If this hotel can be located closer to kota tua it would be really nice",

Penjaringan,"I know the price is cheap but, very unfortunate if it can not keep the hotel clean an awful breakfast. rooms smell of cigarette smoke, bed sheets looks like not replaced. the bathroom was dirty. it seems unsuitable to bring business friends here",
Penjaringan,Old hotel location at pluit a crowded area near laguna apartment. Room is big with double bed or twin bed but old. Breakfast is average. Many street food near there if u hungry at midnight u can find food.,
Penjaringan,"I was interested because of the cheap price they offered. The bed sheets is dirty. Even there was some (looked like) blood stain and other yellow-ish stain in the sheets. I'm not sure they changed the bed sheets before. The bed is HARD AS ROCK. The pillow is miserable. However if you're looking for a cheap price to stay around Pluit (and don't mind the hard and dirty bed) this hotel might be ok. *since I was here with my family, I'm not really recommend Sanno.",
Penjaringan,my self and my friend stayed in the hotel September 23 to 28 2016 staffs and service was good and i have faced only one problem in the hotel is wifi. all the time i went to lobby to use wifi.in the hotel and not only me some people. if the hotel solve this problem it will be good.,

Senen,Overall stay was okay and no welcome drink and welcome fruits anymore provided for ALL members there. Location wise was perfect because near to the mall (Atrium Senen) and they did not provide mineral water in the room as well because they provide a water Dispenser at the corridor so that you can have the mineral water as much as you want.,

Senen,"I was not sure about this hotel at first, but as I walk in to the front office there was a good vibe and warmth. It makes my experience there worthwhile. Although the busy streets of Jakarta made it hard to compliment, but i guess their staff's service has to be regarded with good feedbacks.",
Senen,"I just visited this night to meet my friend who stayed in this hotel. Honestly, I not stayed yet however I have bad experience with their staff especially the security guards. I don’t know what happen there or the sop for them but I think what happened to me as their guest were rude. My friend and I were came to the hotel with a car and driver, from the beginning the security guard give us a kinda rude attitude, without any clear instruction to enter the main gate and do the security check. We still ok with that. Then, we have to wait about one hour and half at the lobby. And for the first time, I felt so annoyed with the security guard. He was walked around us and looked curious and annoyed with us. As my experiences, we can meet someone at the lobby, right? Even we can talk",

Senen,"Clean, comfortable and modern! Everything from the beginning was so easy there. The place is charming, with modern furniture, comfy beds and a really nice bathroom /shower. And the guys at the reception were really kind and helped us a lot. I found Jakarta not that easy -  chaotic and taxi drivers were super unreliable and trying to get the most money out of us - terrible feeling of being helpless, which can totally ruin your vacation. Staff at Maxone's reception helped us book a car (Grab and Go Jek are the local Uber"" providers) to get around and also to the airport. This made a huge difference - I think everything would have been so much more stressful without their help. Just behind the hotel there are some side streets with good local food. I can absolutely recommend this""",

Compared with budget hotels, this hotel offers: - spacious room - toilettries  - various breakfast buffet - straregic location In front of hotel, there is bus shelter 10 minutes walks to reach Atrium mall and Senen 8-10 minutes to Senen station by taxi 15 minutes to Gambir station  Ordered oxtail soup for my lunch with a moderate price on its restaurant the staffs were friendly.  I didn't have any issues about hot water. It ran well. Aircon worked well, too.  The management needs to improve on cleaning aspect, fe. - some water mess on elevator floor - restaurant floor and table Not sure whether it was lack of cleaning staff.",
Senen,"I stayed here one night just because my brother's wedding held in the next door building. I have to tell you this is the worst hotel i've ever lived in. It is 2 star hotel but seems like no star at all. i booked 3 different rooms for me and my family. The closet looks dirty. They forgot to put in refrigerator in one of the rooms we booked, so we have to order one. A lot of coacroch. The reception is not that friendly. I suggest to look for other hotels, some hotels nearby with the same price have better quality. oh and if you broke the hotel key, they will charge you one night rate fee.",
Senen,"The room was awful with Ac not cool enough they offer room change but it was the same, the cleanliness was terrible when flick the curtain can saw a lot of ladies hair from previous guest, noisy sound from road, room look tired, no complimentary mineral water, dispenser infront of the elevator available but the tank empty. The service dissapointing. This hotel you should avoid to stay. Lucky the bfast is OK",
Senen,"I have stayed in this hotel for 10 days with a group  of 50 people.  The hotel is situated in a v crowded neighborhood of Jakarta. The quality of the rooms v a lot in terms of cleaningnness. Unfortunately the hotel is full of cockroaches. There is only wifi in the lobby. We also had the unpleasent visit of rat in the lobby. Although we have signaled this to the staff they did nothing about it. The rat came out every night. For those visiting Jakarta for the first time I will strongly advise to book a different hotel. For the same price, there were other hotels near by, unfortunately for us there was not enough space for 50 people. I must also say that apart from the rat issue, the staff were v helpful and kind.",
Senen,"This was the worst hotel I have been to. The hotel was supposed to be a two star hotel but it was more like a no star"" hotel. It was run down with cockroaches coming out of their hiding place every time you use the bathroom. Oh, the bathroom looked as if it had never been scrubbed and only minimally cleaned. The bed was quite okay but not the pillow which was too high and hard. Leftover food left outside rooms did not seem to get taken away. Crockery used in the dining room seemed older than the age of the hotel which opened in 1993. The hotel staff seemed friendly and helpful enough though.""",
Senen,A little dated and run down but friendly Hotel well-places to escape noise and pollution of Jakarta.  Breakfast buffet good and strong WiFi throughout. Adequate restaurant next door serving cheap food.  Ok for one night but probably no longer,
Senen,"The Hotel is really smelly and it stinks like cigarettes everywhere! My room smelled like a smoking lounge. The Blankets are dirty and just wrapped in a white cover to hide it. The bed is really bendy and you sink like 2 inches into the bed and its uncomfortable. During the night i could hear mice walking inside the walls.  The tub wather is yellow for the first few seconds. Since i am a Vegetarian, I ordered the only vegetarian meal i found on the menu and it was disgusting and there was a dead caterpillar inside. The waiter didn‘t know what a coke was and so I ordered water.  The people working at the reception are really kind tho.",
Senen,"Like a few before we stayed here at the start of a tour and so guessed in advance what it would be like and our average+ expectations were not disappointed.  Arrived by a short cab ride after taking the superb new train from the airport. Less than an hour and no famous Jakarta traffic jams.  Met by friendly receptionist. In fact all staff here were excellent. Big tick.  The Bintang felt like an early 80s business hotel which had seen better days. But the rooms were clean and of good size. The bathrooms a little wiffy with a shower head which had a mind of its own. But hey this is down town Jakarta and if you want the Ritz pay more and stay elsewhere unless you are on a tour in which case just embrace the experience.   Breakfast plentiful, simple and locally focused.   Average is",
Senen,"This isn't the 5 seasons, but it's not a dump.  Overall, decent hotel, no mold smells and all the amenities worked.  - The hotel had decent WIFI, AC, and cleanliness. - Had a safety deposit box at the front desk for your valuables. - In the central/south part of Jakarta - there was a few places to eat nearby if you're comfortable walking the sometimes dangerous streets of Jakarta. -Lots of convenience stores nearby to re-stock on supplies. - Buffet style breakfast was pretty good.  Had a mix of indonesian and western foods",
Senen,"Stayed at this hotel to begin a G Adventures tour of Java. The lobby is typical of a business hotel built in the 70’s- 80’s tired and worn with formal staff and empty restaurant. I was given a key and shown to the elevator... Just about got sick when the elevator doors opened to the stench of 50 years of smoking over tired threadbare carpeting... OK I wasn’t expecting a 4 star experience but... The room was positively abysmal. Old worn furnishings, creaky, saggy beds, light switches built in to a piece of “furniture” between the beds, The chain on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. Bathroom fixtures were loose and in bad repair, te sink was cracked and tiles broken. Here’s a photo of the rusty sink.  Well, we were on a tour and had to leave in the morning so",
Senen,Staff were really nice and helpful. We were satisfited with the quality of the room.. quiet clean and causily..include neccesary stuff.The bed was especially comfortable. We recommend it for backpackers :-),
Senen,"Traveled with office-mate. Stayed here for 2 nights. It's a new hotel - I think so. Small hotel. The Manager is friendly and helpful. Also the staffs are very friendly. Not satisfied with the bed because it's like we're lie-down on a rock even there is a mattress. The blanket also so thin and small. The room floor is not covered with carpet so our sole was attached to dust. The bathroom not very clean. Slow water down in the water hole. At first thought clogged, take time to recede. Even close to the same sink. After all, I'm OK with the service. Please provide a deposit money of Rp200,000 during check-in that will be returned when check-out (even if full payment is made ​​during the online reservation). Near to Atrium (Shopping Mall) - 5 minutes walk. Easy to get taxi in front",
Senen,"Clean, near to pasar senen train station. Good staf and facility. Cafe open for 24H with reasonable price list.  The only thing that surrounding not so conducive but suitable for traveller who just arrived or want to continue for next day journey via train.",
Senen,"the room were really clean, tv, ac, and hot water work nicely. towels and teeth brush are available. no lift, my room were at second floor it quiet tiring to bring my bag up there. the staff was not that friendly but he's helpful. very very close to train station. abt 5min walking you'll be arrive. they also serve breakfast. but not that tasty. hehe  i accidentally stay here because i miss my train. gotta wait till tomorrow for the first train.",
Senen,Road to the hotel is very dirty and lot of strange people who are sleeping on road.entrance is full junkyard and staff very unhelpful.room was full of mosquitoes and bed linen was dirty.asked for breakfast packet as we have to go early and refused.also ask for multi plug hotel did not have it.asked for wakeup call and we never got it.,
Senen,"My taxi had some trouble to find the place, but once I was there the staff was very nice (although not very fluent in English!), the room was clean with complimentary bottles of water. Bed was comfy. Earplugs are a must for the night. Breakfast was ok, and I really liked the chicken satay at the hotel restaurant!",
Senen,"Kamar agak sempit. Kamar mandi sangat bersih dan peralatan mandi cukup lengkap. Yang sedikit membuat tidak nyaman adalah posisi kamar mandi yang persis di sebelah kepala ranjang. Karena jika mematikan lampu semua terlalu gelap, jadi lampu kamar mandi tetap saya nyalakan. Tetapi karena persis di sebelah kepala, jadi terasa agak silau.  Dan karena ini sebenarnya tempat kost, jadi tempat parkirnya sangat terbatas. Agak kesusahan untuk parkir (karena kebetulan saya bawa sepeda motor sendiri).  Lokasi cukup strategis, karena di sekeliling hotel banyak jajanan murah meriah yang semuanya bisa dicapai dengan berjalan kaki saja. Tetapi agak jauh dari pusat perbelanjaan ataupun mall. Jadi kurang recommended untuk traveller yang ingin berbelanja.  Overall, hanya recommended untuk sebatas",
Senen,"Was only able to stay here for a few hours because of a delayed flight but here's my honest opinion:  1. STAFF - The admin in the office we met were very accommodating and would go the extra mile to meet our needs. Sadly, I wasn't able to get his name.  2. ROOM - The room we booked was Twin Beds but they gave us a Queen size bed instead but still, the room is clean as well as the toilet which is good. The only thing I didn't like was the wi-fi because I couldn't connect to it for some reason.  Over all, it was a very relaxing stay and it's in Central though it's a bit hard to find because you have to go to the end of a street.",
Senen,"Typically low class hotel but the best of amenities and services, I've stay for 2 days in this hotel, mostly it was comfortable. They has rooftop balcony to see jakarta from the top. I truly recommended this hotel for u guys, best hotel for low cost.",
Senen,Kamar cukup ok hanya saja channel tv tidak lengkap. Kamar mandi lumayan bersih. Kasur tempat tidur agak keras. Lingkungan sekitar lokasi kurang rapih tapi cukup menguntungkan dengan adanya Indomaret dan penjual makanan.,
Senen,"Clean motel with a cheap price. Shalom also offer pick up and deliver service from airport or train station. Got a clean room, but an interior is too old for now. Near from business area around senen triangle.",
Senen,"Sufficient room (you can choose between 1 - 3 person occupancy) with restaurant for dine in or room service. It is located in the heart of Jakarta, although you have to go to a small road to get through to the motel, but it is worth the budget.",

The location,the kindness of staff & management,food,comfort ,etc. The hotel itself is a stunning building. Our room had gorgeous views, unique and lovely furnishings. The materials used were luxurious- rich , unique panelling. Breakfast was among the best ever had, and there was a real effort to emphasize Indonesian food using local ingredients. There were fresh greens and vegetables we had never encountered before, all artfully presented with numerous accompaniments.Beauty, spaciousness, luxury and comfort were enhanced by the truly amazing service,their staff are very kind to",
Jatinegara,"It was a wonderful suites for Couples and do really comfortable for family to have a short staycation or babymoon! Since the pandemic, they give extra clean for all area and served best! Keep on hard!",
Jatinegara,Value for money. Hotel was clean. Room and bathroom is smaller than normal hotel rooms but it’s fine if you are there just to sleep and not hang out. Staff in restaurant do not speak English. Hard to order food or drinks if you have any questions to ask about the menu.,
Jatinegara,"The room was clean and wide enough for a deluxe type. The amenities just complete as what needed. Overall, the service is great and satisfying.  I do recommend you this hotel if you need a hotel in East Jakarta area (Cawang).",
Jatinegara,"if you have the right budget is not much and not little for your wallet and limited by company budget but you want to stay in hotel with nice variant menu breakfast, have a swimming pool, nice view, i recommend this hotel.  the less is only for wifi not faster if you stay up than 5th floor, the others is if you need to find street food im not recommend for you here because the area is not like in kalibata or menteng or tebet maybe the solution is you must use online ( gofood )",
Jatinegara,"I like to stay here because the reception are friendly (Rara), near to my office even though the room price is higher than my budget.  but I was a LITTLE DISAPPOINTER dbecause they didn’t provide IRON.  I once asked the reception about than and they answered “because they had laundry facilities”.  But it’s not about a price, it’s about TIME.. i have to wait about 30 minutes just to iron my hijab.",
Jatinegara,Had a business meeting last week at Park Hotel Jakarta. I must say that the service is exceptional and the food is amazing. They know what their doing. Will suggest to all business partners to give it a try. I think me & the company I work for will definitely be back because we had such great experience.,
Jatinegara,"7 Days has always been my choice of stay in Jakarta. The hotel is well located with easy access. The thing that I like the most is the cleanliness of the room and the quality of service from the staffs. I would like to thank these few staffs (Egha, Novi & Rifa) that will go an extra mile just to make sure that I am satisfied staying at 7 Days and that had made my stay more memorable and enjoyable every time I visit 7 Days.",
Jatinegara,"2nd time i go to this hotel... 1st time with family, 2nd time with my husband only... Never bored for reserve this hotel, so easy looking for food, beside mall... And beside a market jatinegara... Very very easy for search food, transportation... Nice... I wanna go there again...",
Jatinegara,"We stayed at this hotel last week. Upon checkin the reception staff was rude and not showing courtesy. We stuck in traffic for hours and when came, I asked for a water. The receptionist lady, was having cold water available said sorry you will find the water in room. I was shocked. In room it was boiling hot. I called the reception again, they send a technician. The technician just came saw the remote of AC and said this is standard calling of LG units we have issue . I can’t do any thing further. The two nights we slept in really hot atmosphere. I called the reception to see if you can provide another room or a double key card so when we go out keep the room AC running. The answer from the reception sorry you have to pay to get second key. Whilst checking in I paid in advance",
Jatinegara,"The best thing is just beside the shopping mall. I can spend my whole morning sitting at the Jco beside hotel just for coffee and donuts and rushing my report. Convenience, and receptionist is nice too.",
Jatinegara,"The hotel is in the City Plaza shopping mall, very convenient to have food or shopping, the staffs are nice, room is big and clean, tidy, very value for money. the breakfast is standard, not good, but not bad as well, anyway, value for moeny !",
Jatinegara,"The only reason I booked this hotel is their promotion on Traveloka about private pool. But,  it got cancelled during the holiday season. Than,  my room has no view. They didn't informed that on the application. I can't fell relax while surrounded by wall.  I feel like live in the box. Then I asked receptionist to upgrade the room, I said I will pay for that.  But the receptionist really pissed me off. He rejected my request for unclear reason.  He said no room available,  but than he said he couldn't sold the room just in case other people would like to book it. That's mean,  there was a room,  or even many rooms. He just didn't want to gave it to me. He didn't even apologize or performed a nice gesture. I booked for 2 days, but I called Traveloka, explained my situation and",
Jatinegara,"First impression, I hated the hotel because its smells like hospital . The room is spacious and clean, too bad the air conditioner did not work well, but the technical service man immediately fixed it, so it worked perfectly fine . The breakfast ok, you must try the  Nasi Uduk "" it was the best nasi uduk  I have ever tasted Need adding some fruits though The parking lot need improvement If you want to go shopping  to  'Pasar Jatinegara"" this is the best place to stay""",
Jatinegara,the bedroom is cleaned and looked new all furniture and other stuff and the service are good especially there were varieties of free breakfast. the price is worth it for one star hotel. I was fell safe when I was staying there as I am travelling alone that time. The hotel is based of islamic rule - no married not room - It's a god think!!!,
Jatinegara,"This is the worst hotel ever. The cleaness is fair. The hospitality from the crew is feally bad and can be considered ugly. The front desk people do not speak english well. You have to pay almost a dollar for a cup of hot water if you want to make coffee, mineral waters are ALWAYS complimentary with a room.  The location is not so great too, the best of all for Muslim family because they prohibited having opposite sex (without marriage bonding) guest in the room.",
Jatinegara,"I didn't spend so much time here. I checked in at night to have a rest and put my luggages. Because I spent my day exploring Jakarta city. So, this one is quite good, everyday the housekeeper check and clean our room. Be careful you may find traffic jam outside the hotel because it located in a crowded place, better go earlier. From the outside, this hotel looks like an apartment, and so does inside. Note, they won't allow you to book a room with two different gender inside unless you're married.",
Jatinegara,"So not recommendeeeeeeeed!!!   This hotel was dirty, the cardlock is broken, so if we left the room empty, when we need to enter, we should ask the reception and there are small cockroach..... I just can't sleep well",
Jatinegara,"Room space are adequate, linen are clean and the air-conditioning is great. Toilet are not impressive. they did not clean it well. They need to meet their housekeeping for that. Check is was fast. But when i did check out, the front desk wasn't friendly at all. no smile and not helpful. i hope he get reprimanded.",
Jatinegara,"I'm not going back to this hotel! Small cockroach-like animals are running around in the room. No phone in the room, no bedside lamps, the TV doesn't work, the bathroom door is broken, no drinking water!",
Jatinegara,"Been to this hotel for short"" vacation only, now already 5th times.  but I don't know why the service quality is getting worse each time I visited.  From no soap, no mineral water, dirty towel, and etc. the parking space always full also.  You only can count on the internet connection that is fast enough. Others are terrible.""",
Jatinegara,"I visited my with my family along with my father and mother my law. Arrived at 11.30 PM, and to my surprise THERE ARE NO PARKING SPOT AVAILABLE. What make it worse is that the hotel BLOCKED the only road to get out of the parking lot. Plus, the parking guy BLAMED us because we did not coordinate with him before entering the area. Awful management. Plain terrible.",
Jatinegara,"I plan to stay 3 nights (25-28 August) at this hotel. I got a queen size bed room. At the beginning I have to say that this hotel need to be improved, even-though this is a budget hotel. The receptionists do not wear a uniform and they are not so friendly to the guess. The room is very small, the bed cover looks dirty seem that this hasn’t been replaced from the previous guess. It also the room boy didn’t make the bed so it looks messy. When I turn on the aircon not cool and noisy, so I decided to change the room. I got new room just opposite of the previous room. The new room is a smoking room, I don’t like it but I have no choice since this is the only available room. Things that I don’t like beside the cigarette smell is the room doesn’t have a headlight, so I have to deal",
Jatinegara,"I had been to Zodiak @sutami before and it is a lot better that this place. The best thing only the location.  Don't expect too much when you book this hotel, you'll regret it. room is very small Air conditioner took long time to cool the room only 1 elevator/lift",

The owner of the room was very kind and attended all my requests for WiFi, extra towels (for a small fee) and showed me around. We have access to free gym, 3 swimming pools and sauna. They have a nice garden and basketball court usable under appointment.  Clean and safe.  Affordable. If you need a modest apartment but clean and good service, look for this owner.

Pademangan,"First I want to to commend some of the staff (e.g. Nila @ restaurant, Dhea and Cynthia @ reception) for their efforts and their hospitality.  Unfortunately, but the management does not live up to the standards of Accor Group.  It was highly disappointing to find a lot of black mold under the sink. This is abso absolutely unacceptable from my point of view.  As part of the ALL SAFE efforts, which was attested by a sticker at the door menus, e.g. for breakfast, were removed and replaced by QR codes on the TV.

Pademangan,"first decided to stay at Novotel Jakarta Mangga Dua Square because the hotel was already operating at the time of the Covid pandemic that was hitting Indonesia.   I made a reservation for one night, one room with breakfast for 2 person.  Before the arrival of a staff named Mr. Farhan wanted to confirm the arrival time because as a Accor Live Limitless member he wanted to give a good impression and also wanted to provide all kinds of preferences that I needed when staying at the hotel.  I was very impressed with what he did because he asked for the type of room I wanted. Like do I want a smoking room or not.  he also asked me the time of my arrival to make sure when I arrived the room was ready.   On arrival at the hotel I found it difficult because of the lack of information",
Pademangan,"I really appreciate the hotel's service and staff, especially Mr Rahman who assisted us from the beginning until we checked out. The room was really great, and in my opinion, this is one of the best rooms I have ever stayed.",
Pademangan,"The location is superb, the staffs are friendly and helpful, the room also nice and facilities are great. Love that it provides bathtub, it is basically one of the reason why I choose Novotel on the first place.   Some of the drawbacks for me are basically can be considered as small matters by others, such as lack of refill for water, though whenever we asked they will give it to us, but it's kind of difficult not to be able to find any dispenser so we can refill our water freely anytime, and then the floor plan kind of confusing with lack of info regarding where to locate elevator and our room, so for people like me who unfortunately, not really good with ways, we can get lost (I actually got lost for real), and then, it is better for the housekeeping to check on the flushing",

Pademangan,"well.... this hotel is good first time we come in... lobby is looking great... costumer service is nice... what make me feel not ok was the room... its small and no hand soap no brush teeth.. when we aske they said its for a go green program. we had dinner and breakfst as well... the point is not quiet good. What make us happy is the pool... its cool.. great... and cozy, very nice... they have mini golf that we played... zumba in morning and cooking class for kids and face painting but its cost.",
Pademangan,"Worst hotel.. i felt scammed.. you need to pay fee per person entrance to enter hotel .. this was our family first and last visit.. not recommended. There was many good hotel outside an ol area, better to stay in outside ancol area.",
Pademangan,"- New lobby: Nice and spacious - Checkin: smooth checkin - Room: it seems like just being renovated, quite clean beside the aircond temp can't be adjusted... so the room temp becomes too cold - Bedding: Nice bed except the linen color has turned into grey (from white) and some holes on pillow cover - Extra Bed: Quite shock knowing only mattress without any base - Bathroom: Shower drainage does not go smooth. The shower can't be adjusted between the wall and hand shower. Towel color has also turned into grey from white - Room surroundings: Quite noisy with people slamming the room door and kid running and shouting",
Pademangan,"How could 4 star hotel didn't provide iron and board? the operator said they don't have any iron and board, that's terrible. Also i have a big group on 2nd week of december staying there and the staff at restaurant didn't standby around the restaurant so I had to go to kitchen to ask them to refill the water, cleaning the tables and prepare the utensils. And when I arranged a dinner at Discovery Sky, the only set up tables for 8 tables and cant provide more table when I observed that there is more space. Please consider this review to your management. Many Thanks.",
Pademangan,"Really this is one of the best budget hotel i have ever stay, the room was really met my expectations. Big and clean also the staff name Martha was so very nice! Thankyou Martha for the hospitality. I love this hotel!!!",
Pademangan,"I have stayed in this hotel couple of time already, i love the simplicity of the room design, yet clean and comfy ambience. check in and out is easy. i stay at 207 and 309 i manage to have great sleep, they forgot to setup tumbler at 309 and you might need to have a look at the quality of the towels, it start to torn out. Overall i enjoy my stay and love to return. Thank you and good job!",
Pademangan,"Thanks to D'primahotel WTC Mangga Dua for the satisfying services while I tripped recently. I hope to use the services again in next time I trip. For the satisfying services, I recommend the hotel to stay.",
Pademangan,"The deluxe room is ok is clean but when you leave your food for even 1 hour, there will be a army of ants. The food stall beside the pedestrian is very nice and cheap. Open from evening till late night. There shopping complex opposite the road is very rundown.",
Pademangan,"The staff were friendly. They offer simple breakfast from Starbucks (croissant and coffee). The bed was comfy, room was clean, i had a good stay.   If you’re here for holiday, I wouldn’t recommend you this location. It’s a little far from the center. If you’re going to Kota, you can take the local bus in front of the hotel, it’s convenient and it’s fun to tryout the local transport.  *i forgot to get my deposit back, am still waiting for their reply.",

Pademangan,"This was the resort I used to come as a kid about 40 years ago. Amazingly, it looked mostly the same as it had been for those years. This time I stayed in a ship-shaped like Leti-Leti 111, which had a living area, a pantry, a bathroom and a bedroom. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst experience I had ever had. Number one, the interior was very old and gloomy, and worst of all, it was not well maintained. Number two, the hot water did not work and the toilet water tank did not have the cover. Number three, I did not realize until very early morning (around 4 AM) that on the ceiling of my bedroom there was a lizard that pooped on my bed. There were also insects flying around in my bedroom in that very early morning. So, I could not go back to sleep. I ended up taking a morning",
Pademangan,"It's the only sea side and sea view resort in Jakarta, so it's still popular for weekend get away, or even beach side birthday party. Some area had been renovated, but most of the cottage already old. 😁",
Pademangan,Some food has displayed as a chicken soup but it includes beef if someone with red meat allergy its really bad buffet standard I stayed august 17th to 19th at Bawa 15 room. room quality is average good only bad things happen to me in food because I'm read meat allergy I ask about food two-three times from chef they said the only chicken but it includes beef.,
Pademangan,Stay in putri duyung resort with big family.. the cottage neat and clean..bathroom ok. The staff very helpful and friendly. Got dinner and breakfast too. To bad the swimming pool was under renovation..,
Pademangan,"The hotel itself is large, clean and well maintained with friendly staff.  The rooms are large and clean.  They have tea and coffee making facilities but no fridge. We stayed in a room next to the busy road so it was a bit noisy.   It wasn't too noticeable though but some might have found it too disturbing.  They should put in double glazing for these rooms. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was adequate.  Ancol was very close but because of the roads in-between, its almost impossible to get there by foot.  If you try then you're risking life and limb.  Better to get a taxi.",
Pademangan,"Spacious room, car park, and even the bed. Like it ! Less that 30 us dolar.. near to themepark and mangga dua. The staff ok, friendly and intend to help. My first impression: WORTH IT !! And the extra bed are hugeee. Can be fit for 2 child.",
Pademangan,"We chose the hotel for one night to go to the Thousand Islands early the next morning. Otherwise the hotel is not central. The staff was really helpful and friendly helping us to organise our transportation/ next hotel at Thousand Islands, since there are no travel agencies close by.",
Pademangan,"My first impression: Wow!. The hotel is small but the lobby is super clean and spacious. I was very impressed with the room, huge for 2 occupants. The aircond is not strategically placed though. The room was not really cold although we set to the lowest temperature. The room rate excluded breakfast but because we took the hotel as it was only a stone throw away from the airport (minus the horrific jam of course...) we just had to try the assortment of food they have for breakfast. To my surprise, the food is super delicious! I ordered for 2, but only 1 came, and due to our limited time to head for the airport, I asked for the other to-go instead. Not disappointing as well. The hotel is so nearby Mangga Dua, but we did not explore that side since it was just a one-night transit",
Pademangan,"Pleasant Hotel...! Nice staff, room were great, hospitality number one, great food and just a stone away from Ancol as amusement park (west entrance), Mangga Dua for shopping and Kota Tua for historical trip.",
Pademangan,"To stjerner er for lite for dette hotellet. Alt er egentlig helt OK, bortsett fra at jeg fikk heteslag og måtte ligge utslått på rommet i 34 timer. Men en hyggelig betjening tok godt vare på meg. Sikkert bra for en barnefamilie som tåler varmen og vil benytte seg av badeland, Mini-Disneyland etc. i nærheten.",
Pademangan,"Hotel ini seeing saya lewati, Dengan rasa penasaran saya pun booking di sini  Tempatnya lumayan nyaman bersih parkiran memadai dan fasilitas yg cukup baik menurut saya Tempatnya strategis Dekat dengan pusat perbelanjaan dan wisata ancol",
Pademangan,"kemrin saya berpergian dan menginap di hotel ini, booking utk deluxe room untuk segi harga sangatlah worthit akan tetapi di dalam kamar tidak terdapat lemari pakaian, cuma lemari tmpt menaruh tas dll. untuk segi kebersihan ok, dan view nya pun ok saat di pagi hari, dan 1 lagi yg saya suka, breakfast nya sangatlah recommend, makanannya enak, kita disuguhi berbagai piliahan.",
Pademangan,"I believe most poor review here was for the old hotel before it was fully acquired and renovated by OYO (budget hotel chain). So don't read any of these review when it was dated before year 2020.  I stayed here for vacation with a friend. The room is spacious and relatively clean. Ceramic flooring. The bed is firm and comfortable. Linen looks clean, however our towel got little stain on it. Bathroom is huge and clean as well, water temperature is easy to adjust with strong current coming out of shower head.   the basic OYO amenities is provided (cheap quality shower gel, shampoo and dental kit). During checkin, the receptionist gave glass water bottle that can be refilled anytime.  Hotel was eerily quiet at night, that ambience of old hotel is still there, and the yellowish",
Pademangan,"WORST HOTEL EVER, does not even deserve 1 star. everything is old and dirty, you might get herpes by staying here! We wore slippers in the room cuz floor so disgusting. And the room has a ghostly vibe. 1- Blood stains (probably cum stains too) on towel and bed sheet 2- Aircond slightly cooler than the sun 3- Decorational Fridge 4- Toilet with accumulated dirt and gunk, never cleaned since 1980s maybe? 5- Elevator that stops on every level 6- Muddy pool where you can't see the bottom (could be snakes or crocs in there!) 7- Creaky doors 8- Creepy shady corridors 9- Cafe - No Aircond, Oily Food, Dirty Utensils 10- NO IN ROOM WIFI!! (only in lobby or cafe) 11- Zombie Staffs (we checked out, they took the room key, then continue to do their work, leaving us standing there for no",
Pademangan,"Big room and classy. What you pay is what you get. Close to mangga dua square, JIEXPO kemayoran. The staff is friendly. Have public pool. Your mineral water compliment not inside room, in path way with galon dispenser. My floor squized and water out from there.  I like the breakfast, mie goreng and fried chicken so yummy.",
Pademangan,"Bloodied sheets (from previous occupants I assume), rude, ignorant and unapologetic manager.  Old, decrepit, dirty rooms, no working fridges, all old, unused, no mini bar as advertised.   No bath, no hot water, until I complained. No free internet in rooms. Air-con very old, cut off and didn't work after 2 hours. Location isn't great like some people have mentioned, still a taxi ride from anywhere worth going, and Gambir train station. Dirty river outside, and pretty much no amenities, restaurants or attractions nearby.  Cleaning staff, instead of cleaning our room, smoked in it, and didn't lift the bloodied sheets that I had already pointed out as a major issue.  I'll reiterate though, the worst issue with this hotel was the audacity and ignorance of the manager, who (without",
Pademangan,"Booked an family room. The rooms were outdated and full of ants. At night it was infested with Mosquito and the air con is almost non existence. The breakfast served was only fried noodles and rice. For additional order, for kids they charged adult price but without receipt.",
Pademangan,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights because we were not sure where to stay in Jakarta. From the photos, it looked like everything is a good as new but in reality, you don’t want to be staying in the room the whole day. Since we did spent our time outside and only came back at night to shower and sleep, we can’t really complain much.  The only thing I can’t understand is why is our room’s aircond facing our bathroom. The room took time to cool down and mind you, we can hear the sound of train as if it is next to our room too.  Walking distance to Pasar Pagi so this is a good point for those who want to shop for batik and other apparel. It is also walking distance to the museums and convenient store.   Breakfast was uhh.. not so impressive but it does caters for locals.  Staff was",
Pademangan,"Very unimpressed with this hotel - we stayed 4 nights and on the first day we arrived most rooms were unoccupied - and they stayed that way most of the time we were there. This should have been a sign.  We spotted 1 or 2 ants on the first day on the floor and thought nothing of it - by day 2 there were so many of them all over the floor and beds. We told reception who said they would spray the room - which they did. But the next night we saw more ants and told them again. The windows do not shut properly and the air-conditioning was poor.  We asked for nearby places to book trips to snorkel etc and the gentleman on the desk put us in touch with his friend"" Karl. We paid 500,000 each for a day trip with multiple snorkel trips, lunch and a private boat. Not only did he not show""",
Pademangan,"apart from a very helpful and polite staff, everything about this hotel is a big zero...stayed there with my family for 2 nights...its noisy outside throughout the day...i think there are far better options for the same price...",

Pademangan,"Twins hotel is about 10 minutes walk to Kota Station and the old quarter, and merely 5 minutes walk to Mangga Dua mall. The location is key plus point to stay in this hotel.  The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms size is OK and it is clean.  The Wifi speed is good and no hiccup during my stay. Breakfast is simple but it's tasty. Will come back to stay here again next visit !",
